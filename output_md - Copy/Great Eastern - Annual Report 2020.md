## DEAR SHAREHOLDERS

The year 2020 has been unique and eventful from its onset. The COVID-19 pandemic escalated very quickly, affecting communities and businesses around the world. In these unprecedented times, economies and healthcare systems have been tested, and governments around the world implemented movement restrictions and safe distancing measures to contain the virus. These measures triggered an economic downturn led by a slowdown in global activities. We saw sharp declines in the prices of risk assets and interest rates, the widening of credit spreads and increase in market volatility in the first half of 2020.

The severe economic disruption in turn led to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy responses. Central banks significantly eased monetary policies by cutting policy rates to historical lows. Proactive policy responses and the gradual reopening of major economies globally underpinned a synchronised economic recovery and an impressive rebound in risk assets in the second half of 2020. This recovery gathered momentum in the last quarter of the year, fuelled by the roll-out of vaccines and the results of the US presidential election.

The low interest rate environment has posed challenges to the insurance industry in managing the in-force balance sheet and structuring competitive savings/investment products for our customers. We have proactively reduced our risk exposures and conserved our capital for long-term investment opportunities that may arise. At the same time, our proactive assetliability management capability has allowed us to continue to launch attractive products to meet our customers' needs.

As a leading regional life insurer, we are mindful of our corporate social responsibilities. Hence, a key focus for us was to do our part in providing strong support to those impacted. Across the markets where we operate, we pledged funds totalling over S$3 million to assist our customers, representatives and their immediate family members, as well as local charities. We instituted

programmes to defer premium payments and to offer flexible premium payment schemes to our individual and corporate customers to ensure that they could continue to maintain their insurance coverage during these challenging times.

Across  the  Group,  we  have  accelerated our transformation efforts in order for us to continuously  deliver  professional  financial advice and services to our customers. This also enabled us to overcome the disruptions arising from the controls on people movement that prohibited face-to-face contact with our various stakeholders. The digital and transformation initiatives that were put in place since 2018 have helped propel our business during this period. We were among the first insurers in the region to launch a fully remote advisory and sales process, enabling our customers to seamlessly fulfil their financial planning and insurance needs virtually, with their advisors. With our bank partner OCBC Bank, there has been closer collaboration to better understand customers' needs and improve the customer journey. We have further strengthened our digital affinity partnerships to broaden our reach into new customer segments.

Overall, there was minimal impact to our service levels and business operations as we were able to effectively scale up our work-from-home capabilities for over 6,000 employees across the region.

Despite the challenging business and market conditions, the Group has remained resilient and maintained our market leadership positions in Singapore and Malaysia. Our investment portfolios  have  weathered  the  economic downturn well, which could be attributed to a well-diversified high quality asset portfolio and a strong risk management framework. Our strong balance sheet and prudent portfolio management capabilities have enabled us to stay invested and ride through this market downturn, and subsequently benefit from the strong market recovery during the second half of the year.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

In 2020, the Group delivered a strong performance despite the challenging business environment. The Group's Total Weighted New Sales rose by 23% to S$1,543.7 million compared to the same period last year.  New Business Embedded Value,  a  measure  of  long-term  economic profitability, increased by 9% to S$669.5 million, a reflection of our strong product proposition and distribution network. The Group's operating profit from insurance business continued its growth momentum and achieved an 11% increase to S$730.7 million. On a full-year basis, the Group's Profit Attributable to Shareholders reported a 4% decrease to S$960.6 million for FY2020, amid less favourable financial market conditions for the year compared to FY2019.

Our strong performance is anchored on a strong risk and compliance culture, and our Board playing a key role in setting the governance standards to meet our stakeholders' expectations. We operate within parameters and constraints that are calibrated to the Board-approved risk appetite, and will always uphold the highest standards of corporate governance, transparency and disclosure as we strive for excellence.

The Board has recommended the payment of a final one-tier tax-exempt dividend of 50 cents per ordinary share. Upon shareholders' approval, the final dividend will be paid on 5 May 2021. Including the interim one-tier tax-exempt dividend of 10 cents per ordinary share paid in August 2020, total dividends for the financial year 2020 would amount to 60 cents per ordinary share.

## STRENGTHENING OUR FINANCIAL REPRESENTATIVE NETWORK

In 2020, the Group witnessed the resilience of  our  financial  representative  network  in overcoming  challenges.  The  Great  Digital Advantage platform, launched in 2018, was a key foundational capability empowering our financial representatives to respond nimbly to changing consumer behaviour, needs and expectations, which were elevated by this pandemic.

![Image](output_md\Great Eastern - Annual Report 2020_artifacts\image_000017_4304262b47fb3eb7193cb55dbae9f45d728c8e556e8fab6a322c2c6a20011e5a.png)

Our fully remote advisory and sales process enabled our financial representatives to provide seamless financial advisory services to their customers and address their insurance needs via multiple virtual touchpoints, including our digital platforms.

Throughout the year, we launched a suite of products which enabled our financial representatives to continue engaging with existing and new customers. By sharing an online link, they could recommend these products to their customers to self-purchase, which helped uplift their productivity.

During this period, in place of physical roadshows, events and seminars, we initiated a series of topical webinars for our financial representatives to further connect with existing and prospective customers.

In Singapore and Malaysia, we stepped up to support careers in the insurance sector and grew our financial representative footprint. Social media platforms were essential in helping to promote our recruitment programmes. These initiatives enabled us to grow our network to over 5,000 in Singapore and approximately 30,000 in Malaysia.

LIMITED

## STRENGTHENING OUR BANCASSURANCE CHANNEL

During the first half of the year, the pandemic caused a significant drop in footfall to bank branches, thus impacting bancassurance sales. Driven by these challenges, there was greater collaboration with OCBC Bank to better understand and evolve the customer journey, aligning our insurance solutions to better serve their changing needs. In our markets, we integrated our insurance offerings into the bank's digital platforms and ecosystems to optimise performance and create seamless customer journeys.

To address the business impact in Singapore, OCBC Bank launched remote sales advisory capabilities to enable their sales network to serve their customers' financial needs. They were able to engage their customers through digital, telesales and direct channels. We developed new protection, savings and investment-linked insurance products (ILP) to provide the versatility of both protection and wealth accumulation options to customers.

In  Malaysia,  our  bancassurance  business  remained consistently strong with OCBC Bank, emerging as the top foreign bancassurance bank. In partnership with the bank, we launched a legacy customer campaign to promote legacy products to their customers.

For Bank OCBC NISP in Indonesia, while bancassurance sales were slow in the first half of 2020, we saw a strong recovery in the second half of the year. We unveiled new protection and savings products to better support our partner to cater to their customers' needs. We further expanded partnerships with new banks such as Bank Muamalat Indonesia to provide credit life Shariah products to their housing loan customers.

## DEEPENING OUR AFFINITY PARTNERSHIPS

In 2020, we focused on further strengthening our affinity partnerships to broaden our reach into new customer segments. We worked in close collaboration with our partners and leveraged their deep customer insights to curate customised products for targeted customer segments.

In collaboration with telecommunications provider Singtel, we launched home and motor general insurance solutions in Singapore. With ActiveSG, we offered personal accident insurance to its members via its mobile app.

In Malaysia and Indonesia, we worked closely with Axiata Digital to design customised segment-aligned insurance solutions for their customers via their digital and ecosystem platforms. We leveraged Axiata's digital marketing capability to drive awareness and deepen our digital presence on their platforms.

In Indonesia, we also partnered with other technology-based fintech and insurtech companies to provide simple and affordable insurance with a seamless and customer-friendly experience.

## GROWING OUR GENERAL AND GROUP INSURANCE BUSINESS

Overall, our General Insurance business demonstrated resilience in the region, driven by our focus on the retail segment, portfolio realignment and expense discipline, as we continued to digitalise our business, strengthen our distribution model and upgrade our online capabilities. We are putting in place a new General Insurance administrative system which will enable us to design innovative products, improve operational efficiency, and respond rapidly to market competition.

In Singapore and Malaysia, we have taken action on several fronts towards achieving positive underwriting results and improving operational excellence. Our continued effort to pivot our business models has allowed us to focus on growing our retail segment.

With the successful integration of PT Great Eastern General Insurance Indonesia into the Great Eastern Group, we have put in place our bancassurance partnership with Bank OCBC NISP, and strengthened our relationship with the local and international broking community. The focus on retail business and digital affinity contributed to the improvement of our top line growth and underwriting results.

Our Group Insurance business delivered strong sales and underwriting performance in 2020. We adopted a holistic approach to grow our employee benefits scheme, and expanded our network of telemedicine providers to meet increased market demand for General Practitioner coverage and virtual consultations in the region. We further introduced home services for executive health screenings and influenza vaccinations to enrich our service offering to deliver greater convenience and safety to our corporate users.

## ENHANCING OUR CUSTOMER PROPOSITIONS

As a leading regional insurer, our business is grounded upon protecting our customers and helping them to protect themselves, with early financial planning, protection and savings solutions in place. Across the region, we enhanced our product propositions by launching relevant benefits and features to provide greater assurance for our customers.

In Singapore, in line with heightened awareness in protection coverage, we enhanced our investment-linked plan GREAT

Life Advantage , with more critical illness protection riders, as well as retrenchment waiver benefits. Amid the pandemic, we launched GREAT SP , a short-term endowment plan, with complimentary telehealth services. Driven by the increase in Dengue cases, we offered GREAT MozzieSafe via online platforms for easy access.

As one of the three approved private insurers to provide complementary private insurance plans to augment the government's CareShield Life scheme, we launched GREAT CareShield Enhanced and GREAT CareShield Advantage long-term disability plans.

We are pleased and honoured to be the sole insurer appointed by the Central Provident Fund Board for its enhanced Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS) from 1 April 2021. We will now play a pivotal role in making insurance accessible to the working population in Singapore. We hope to be able to leverage our appointment to offer a suite of value-added services and products to DPS members.

In Malaysia, health and critical illness protection solutions were our focus. Following its success in Singapore in 2019, Great Generation Care was Malaysia's first insurance plan to provide comprehensive critical illness protection for three generations in a family under a single plan. We also launched the Smart Multi Critical Care ,  an investment-linked rider, which provides comprehensive critical illness coverage and encompasses multi-claim features.

For our Takaful business, we continued to enhance our product suite to comprehensively address customers' needs. Our takaful Harapan series providing affordable life and medical coverage, has attracted strong demand. Progressing in our mission to provide more people with protection solutions in Malaysia, we moved into our second year as the takaful operator for Malaysia's my Salam government scheme to deliver coverage to the lower income households (B40). We made strides in education and awareness through our kiosks at public and university hospitals, and have seen a marked increase in the number of policyholders benefitting from this scheme in 2020.

In Indonesia, we enhanced our product offerings to holistically address our customers' protection and wealth management needs. This included MaxPrestige Heritage Protector ,  a universal life product; Super Investlink Plan 101 , an ILP product providing additional allocations to investment funds; and Great Optima Link + Great Term Cover package, providing one of the highest protection coverage in the market.

## EMBRACING CUSTOMER CENTRICITY

As part of our continuing effort to put our customers first, we implemented several digital solutions with the aim of providing greater convenience and a better overall experience for them.

In Singapore, we launched the Great Eastern App to give our customers 24/7 visibility of their insurance portfolios. This provides them with convenience and ease of access to their policies anytime, and allows them to make service requests directly on their mobile devices. To further improve customer experience, we implemented corporate PayNow to provide premium payment options to our customers, and revamped our Health Connect to encourage our Integrated Shield customers to use our medical specialist panel. Additionally, we implemented the Predictive Underwriting Model for life and critical illness products which enabled us to serve our customers with greater speed and efficiency.

A new WhatsApp-based servicing channel, Great Eastern Mobile Assistance, was launched in Indonesia to provide our customers with a wider range of remote customer service options. In addition, a new web-based platform which allows for digital signatures, was introduced to facilitate greater convenience and security for insurance sales.

In an age where data privacy is highly valued, we want to provide our customers with the assurance that their personal data is safe with us. We demonstrated this commitment to data protection by becoming the first insurance company in Singapore to obtain both the Data Protection Trustmark and APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules system certifications for Data Privacy, endorsed by Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority.

## ENHANCING OUR TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES

In line with our growth agenda and digital transformation strategy, we continued to invest heavily in our technological capabilities.

We implemented a Group-wide private cloud infrastructure which enabled us to scale quickly to support business agility for our online business, and respond rapidly to changing customer expectations and market competition. We continued our transformation journey to refresh our Life and General Insurance core systems to allow us to operate with greater flexibility and speed.

We enhanced our enterprise visual analytics capability to improve efficiency in management reporting for better data insights. In addition, we continued to extend Robotics Process Automation to enhance our operational processes across the Group.

As  we  evolve  our  business  operating  model  through digitalisation, we are constantly enhancing our data protection and cybersecurity capabilities, and implementing targeted controls to strengthen our defence against increased cyber risk.

## INVESTING IN PEOPLE

Recognising that our employees and financial representatives are our greatest assets, we are committed to being the employer of choice and providing a conducive environment for our people to grow together. This meant that we had to take immediate action to protect their well-being and help them adjust to new ways of working during the year.

Staff engagement sessions took the form of virtual town halls and webinars to help keep our employees and financial representatives connected on business developments. Other activities organised throughout the year focused on health and wellness amid COVID-19. For new employees and financial representatives, virtual orientations were the order of the day.

To future-proof employees for the digital economy, we continued to invest in people development with e-learning modules offered throughout the year, and held a #FutureReady Virtual Learning Carnival on topics including Sustainability, Cybersecurity and Insurtech. We outlined a Generic Skills and Competencies module identifying soft skills development to align employee behaviour with traits such as Customer Orientation, Accountability and Leadership.

For our financial representatives, we implemented a blended learning approach involving e-learning, virtual classroom training and webinars. To further enhance our training programmes, we introduced a suite of topical learning modules on digital platforms which they could conveniently access on demand.

As part of the company's wider workplace transformation initiative,  we  piloted  flexi-work  arrangements  and correspondingly explored workspace redesign. A total of 900 employees were relocated to our redesigned office at Changi to foster better collaboration and innovation.

## GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY

Particularly in these trying times, we see the importance of doing our part as a responsible corporate citizen and making a meaningful difference. From the onset of COVID-19, we announced in Singapore a S$1 million COVID-19 Customer Care Fund to support customers and immediate family members impacted by the pandemic with hospitalisation and death benefits, and set up a COVID-19 Agency Force

Fund to help support our representatives and their families. We unveiled a Financial Assistance Programme in Malaysia, a Care Fund Programme in Indonesia, and a support package in Brunei to help affected customers. To further demonstrate our care for the community, we contributed over S$500,000 under our Great Eastern Cares initiative to help the vulnerable, and supported the Malaysian government's COVID-19 Test Fund.

To help impacted policyholders maintain insurance coverage despite economic pressures, our Deferment of Premium Payment programmes across Singapore and Malaysia helped over 3,400 life policyholders. We additionally supported our General Insurance customers impacted by business shutdowns with flexible premium payment schemes, while group corporate SME customers could pay their premiums via quarterly instalments.

In January 2021, we further pledged a S$1 million GREAT Vaccine Fund in Singapore to provide hospitalisation benefits for customers, employees, representatives and their immediate families in the event of complications arising from approved COVID-19 vaccinations, supporting the national vaccination effort.

## INDUSTRY RECOGNITION

During the year, we garnered many awards and accolades. We reached our highest-ever brand ranking of 5th position in the 2020 edition of Singapore's Top 100 Most Valuable Brands, an annual ranking by independent consultancy Brand Finance.

We were named Top Insurer in Singapore by CampaignAsia's Asia T op 1000 Brands survey conducted by Nielsen in 2020, and were again 1st for the sixth year running in the Life Insurance Sector of the Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG), conducted by the Institute of Service Excellence (Singapore Management University). In recognition of the company's substantive progress in workplace transformation and skills development, we were awarded the Institute of Banking &amp; Finance Inspire Award in January 2021.

In Malaysia, we received the Reader's Digest Most Trusted Brand for the 17th consecutive year and the BrandLaureate Brand of the Year Award for our Life business. Great Eastern was recognised as one of HR Asia's Best Companies to Work for in Asia 2020 (Malaysia edition) for the 5th year running. We received the Most Valuable Brand Award in the BrandLaureate e-Branding Awards 2020 for our Takaful business.

We won several awards in Indonesia such as the Best Insurance Award 2020 by Investor Magazine, and were recognised among the country's Top 5 Most Admired Companies (Life

Insurance) by Warta Ekonomi Magazine. The CEO of our Life business in Indonesia was awarded Outstanding Leadership for Corporate Strategy in Indonesia's Most Admired CEO Awards 2020 by Warta Ekonomi Magazine.

## OUR SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES

In 2020, we sought to make sustainability central to our business and made significant strides on this front. Driving change from the top, we established a Board Sustainability Committee to provide oversight on Group-wide sustainability efforts and to reinforce our commitment to incorporating core principles into business operations for the long term.

We also shaped our sustainability approach in a way that complements our strategic focus by establishing three primary objectives: (1) Transitioning to a low-carbon economy (2) Improving people's lives and (3) Engaging in responsible business practices.

Moving towards a low-carbon economy, we transformed paper-centric processes to digital and electronic platforms, and have formally incorporated responsible investment considerations into our investment process. We have further commenced the set-up of relevant data infrastructure and systems to measure carbon emissions and intensity across various investor accounts.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

As the appointed insurer for DPS in Singapore and my Salam in Malaysia, we help to improve lives and close protection gaps by providing sustainable basic insurance. As an employer, our #FutureReady Framework is designed to build a skilled, resilient and adaptable workforce which will provide greater job security for our employees.

With our sustainability approach and objectives defined, we will continue to progressively roll out initiatives in 2021 and beyond. We will make insurance accessible to broader segments of our communities through our digital platforms, and actively help our customers live healthier, better and longer through our integrated health and wellness programme. We will also create a nurturing and engaging work environment that enables our people to realise their full potential.

We will manage the risks and opportunities arising from climate change and promote a low-carbon economy by continuing our efforts to manage the environmental footprint of our operations, and incorporate environmental, social and governance considerations in our investment portfolios. At the same time, we will safeguard trust and protect value for our stakeholders through robust governance and economic contributions.

## CHANGES TO THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

There have been several new and revised regulations issued in 2020 and we have taken the necessary steps to comply with them. Additionally, we provided our feedback on consultation papers and ensured timely submission to the respective regulators across our markets.

In Singapore, key regulations issued by MAS in 2020 include the following:

Revised regulations on valuation and capital framework for insurers which set out the requirements under the risk-based capital (RBC 2) framework, including the way in which assets and liabilities are to be valued;

Revised Notice on Management of Participating Life Insurance Business to introduce new requirements on the allocation of charges and expenses to Participating Fund and the inclusion of a non-exhaustive list of non-chargeable expenses for the Par Fund. Insurers are expected to meet Policyowners' Reasonable Expectation (PRE) in a fair and reasonable manner when charging expenses into Par Fund which took effect from 1 January 2021;

Guidelines on Individual Accountability and Conduct (IAC Guidelines) which promotes a strong culture of responsibility and ethical behaviour of financial institutions (FIs). The IAC Guidelines outline five accountability and conduct outcomes for  FIs  to  promote  accountability of senior managers, strengthen oversight of material risk personnel, and reinforce conduct standards among all employees. The IAC Guidelines will take effect from 10 September 2021;

Guidelines on Environment Risk Management for Insurers outlines  the  risk  management  practices  to  insurers' underwriting and investment activities and other activity that expose the insurers to material environment risk. These Guidelines aim to enhance the insurance sector's resilient management of environmental risk. On an annual basis, it  is  mandatory for insurers to disclose the approach in managing the environmental risk to their stakeholders, while the disclosure on potential impact of the material environmental risk is encouraged;

The Consultation Paper on Identity Verification was issued to counter the rising number of impersonation fraud and unauthorised financial transactions arising from theft and misuse of an individual's personal particulars. MAS proposed several authentication controls for verification of an individual's identity for non-face-to-face contact. FIs must not rely on common personal information as the sole means for identification verification.

In Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) issued the guidelines on Risk Management in Technology (RMiT) outlining the Information Technology (IT) securities requirements to manage technology and cyber risks. FIs are required to implement the Technology Risk Management Framework (TRMF) and Cyber Resilience Framework (CRF) to strengthen controls in safeguarding the information infrastructure, systems, data and cyber resilience.

In Indonesia, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) issued the circular on Distribution Channel of Insurance Product to provide detailed guidelines for insurance companies and their distribution partners for the marketing and distribution of insurance products. Insurers are required to obtain prior OJK approval to enter into digital distribution partnership with non-bank entities.

## BUSINESS OUTLOOK AHEAD

The change in business landscape has introduced new opportunities for us to differentiate ourselves and grow. We will continue to upskill internal capabilities to leverage data analytics to deepen our customer insights and develop segment-aligned product solutions  to  capture  market opportunities.

The Great Digital Advantage platform will be further enhanced to empower our financial representatives with complete endto-end digitalisation solutions to engage, acquire and transact with customers throughout their life stages.

We will continue to collaborate closely with our bancassurance partner OCBC Bank, to evolve the sales model and product propositions to meet their customers' changing behaviours and needs. We will further leverage our affinity partners' platforms and customer bases to deepen our digital presence and reach new customer segments.

Our touchpoints and capabilities will be upgraded to provide a seamless customer experience. We will further strengthen our engagement programmes and platforms to forge closer ties with our customers. To allow our business to respond with speed and agility, our technology infrastructure and digital capabilities will correspondingly be enhanced.

Accelerating our transformation initiatives will enable us to grow and strengthen our market leadership in Singapore and Malaysia, while elevating our growth in Indonesia through product innovation and a diversified distribution network.

In 2021, we foresee that the combination of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, and progress in COVID-19 vaccines globally, is likely to enable the global economy to recover. Nonetheless, while there are reasons to be optimistic, we are mindful of potential volatility in the year ahead given the knowledge now about the unprecedented ability of the COVID-19 virus to evolve and mutate rapidly.

The buildout of the pandemic and its effects on the economy and hence corporate earnings continue to be the biggest risks, as uncertainty remains regarding the safety, distribution, and uptake of the vaccines, and their eventual impact on economic recovery. Emergency COVID-19 spending has raised the national debt burden for many governments, especially those in emerging markets. Any rise in interest rates and borrowing costs will exacerbate the fragile balance of the payment situation of these economies. Geopolitical risks and global policy uncertainty will remain elevated with the US-China discord.

While we are optimistic that economic growth should be positive this year, we recognise that developed markets are showing signs of exuberance. Any new adverse developments with regard to the pandemic could cause markets to reverse course rapidly. Hence, we will continue to remain vigilant and adopt a prudent approach in our underwriting and investment operations, and proactively manage our investment portfolios.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We would like to record our sincere gratitude to Mr Samuel Tsien, who will be stepping down from the Board at the Company's Annual General Meeting in April 2021. The Group has benefitted from his invaluable contributions and insights over the past nine years.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## EMBEDDED VALUE

An actuarial embedded value is a commonly used technique to assess the economic value of the existing business of a life insurance company. Looking at a company's distributable profits for a year, or even a few years, is not a reliable guide to its long-term economic value. This is because the timing of distributable profits arising from a profitable insurance policy may involve accounting losses in the initial policy years and higher accounting profits in later years that will make the policy profitable overall. The loss in the initial years is due to the initial expenses of writing new business, combined with the need to meet capital requirements. As a result, in any one year, high growth of business may tend to lower distributable profits. Embedded values have therefore been developed as a way to assess the long-term economic value of a life insurance company for the existing blocks of business.

The embedded value of Great Eastern Holdings Limited ('the Group') has been determined using the traditional deterministic cash flow methodology that has been adopted historically for embedded value reporting, and comprises the sum of the value of In-Force Business and the value of the adjusted Shareholders' Funds.

## VALUE OF IN-FORCE BUSINESS

This represents an estimate of the economic value of projected distributable profits to shareholders, i.e. after-tax cash flows less increases in statutory reserves and capital requirements attributable to shareholders, from the In-Force Business at the valuation date, i.e. 31 December 2020. The cash flows represent a deterministic projection, using best estimate assumptions of future operating experience and are discounted at a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of a risk-adjusted discount rate, together with an allowance for the cost of holding statutory reserves and meeting capital requirements, represent the allowance for risk in the value of In-Force Business together with an implicit allowance for the cost of options and guarantees provided to policyholders. It should be noted that this allowance for risk is approximate and may not correspond precisely with the allowance determined using capital market consistent techniques.

In projecting the value of In-Force Business, the statutory reserve valuation bases and capital requirements are based on the Risk Based Capital framework as set out in prevailing local regulations for Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia as of 31 December 2020.

In Singapore, the Group's asset management company Lion Global Investors Ltd ('LGI') manages a proportion of the Singapore Life Funds' assets for which fees are payable from each Fund. In line with generally accepted traditional embedded valuation methodologies in respect of services provided by asset management companies within our insurance group, the present value of profits arising in LGI from the fees paid by Singapore Life Fund is included in the embedded value and new business value of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020.

## ADJUSTED SHAREHOLDERS' FUND

This represents the value of assets over and above that required to meet statutory reserves, capital requirements and other liabilities.

## ASSUMPTIONS USED

The assumptions adopted for the calculations have been determined taking into account the recent experience of, and expected future outlook for, the life insurance business of the companies involved, i.e. The Great Eastern Life Assurance Company Limited ('GEL') in Singapore, Great Eastern Life Assurance (Malaysia) Berhad ('GELM') and Great Eastern Takaful Berhad ('GETB') in Malaysia and PT Great Eastern Life Indonesia ('GELI') in Indonesia.

Investment returns assumed are based on the long term strategic asset mix and their expected future returns. The risk-adjusted discount rate used is 6.0% for Singapore, 7.75% for Malaysia and 12.5% for Indonesia.

## EMBEDDED VALUE CALCULATION

The value of In-Force Business has been calculated for the life insurance business of GEL in Singapore, GELM and GETB in Malaysia and GELI in Indonesia, along with the adjusted Shareholders' Funds for the Group. The results of the calculations as at 31 December 2020 are as follows:

| Embedded Value (S$ millions)                                           | Singapore*   | Malaysia^   | Total   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Life Business Value of In-Force Business                               | 5,712        | 3,713       | 9,425   |
| Shareholders' Funds and Non-Life Business Adjusted Shareholders' Funds | 7,020**      | 983         | 8,003   |
| Total Embedded Value                                                   | 12,732       | 4,696       | 17,428  |

** Includes businesses in Brunei and Hong Kong

^ Includes GETB.

## ECONOMIC VALUE OF ONE YEAR'S NEW BUSINESS

The economic value of one year's new business, defined as the value of projected shareholder distributable profits from new business sold in the year, is used to determine the estimated value of future distributable profits from new sales. Using the same best estimate, reserving and capital requirement assumptions as those used for the In-Force Business, the economic value of business written for the year ended 31 December 2020 has been calculated as follows:

| Values (S$ millions)   | Singapore   | Malaysia*   | Others^   | Total   |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Economic Value of      |             |             |           |         |
| One Year's             |             |             |           |         |
| New Business           | 361         | 301         | 8         | 670     |

* Includes GETB.

^ Includes GELI and Group's regional operations in Brunei.

## INDEPENDENT REVIEW

The embedded value, the value of one year's new business and the analysis of change in embedded value during the year were determined by the Group. PricewaterhouseCoopers Southeast Asia Consulting performed a review of the methodology used (based on the traditional deterministic embedded value reporting approach), the assumptions and procedures adopted, the materiality thresholds and limitations and performed a high level review of the results of the Group's calculations.

## SCENARIO TESTING

In addition, some scenario tests were conducted using different investment return assumptions and risk-adjusted discount rates. The results are summarised below:

| Values (S$ millions)                      | Base Scenario   | Investment +0.5%   | Investment -0.5%   | Discount Rate +1.0%   | Discount Rate -1.0%   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|

![Image](output_md\Great Eastern - Annual Report 2020_artifacts\image_000064_84f925cf5be3388815228cf4842965725caaae6cb23ce3d74b2949bd872ac30f.png)

In 2020, our Singapore operations comprising Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd (GELS) and Great Eastern General Insurance (GEG), registered an overall good performance despite challenges during the year.

Total Weighted New Business premiums grew 35% to S$1,053.1 million as a result of a strong performance by our financial representative network and successful well-received product launches.  New  Business  Embedded  Value increased by 20% to S$361.1 million. Our General Insurance business reduced by 9% to S$150.6 million in gross written premiums year-on-year.

Although we faced challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our focus to meet customer needs and expectations through our insurance solutions, professional financial advisory and quality customer service.

The transformation initiatives put in place since 2018 played an important part in helping to drive our business forward during this period. During 2020, we accelerated our transformation efforts to ensure our business operations and service levels continued uninterrupted.

From  the  onset  of  the  pandemic,  we  put  together  a S$1 million COVID-19 Customer Care Fund to help customers and immediate families with hospitalisation and death benefits if impacted. We further pledged a S$1 million GREAT Vaccine Fund in January 2021, to provide hospitalisation benefits for customers, employees and financial representatives, and their immediate families in the event of complications arising from approved vaccinations, in support of the nation's vaccination effort.

In 2020, we helped over 2,000 life policyholders continue their policies through the Deferment of Premium Payment Programme announced in April. We also extended support to customers with our travel insurance plans and waived administrative fees for those forced to change their travel plans due to movement restrictions.

To help ease financial strain for policyholders affected by business slowdown, we rolled out measures including a flexible premium payment scheme for our corporate customers.

## STRENGTHENING OUR DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES

Building on our earlier digital transformation efforts, we empowered our financial representatives to deliver seamless financial advisory services to their customers, and enabled them to more efficiently manage their sales activities during the year.

As one of the first insurers in Singapore to introduce a fully remote advisory and sales process in early March, we were able to provide customers access to continuous financial advisory services on digital channels. We enabled our financial representatives to recommend and share products with customers via personalised online links. Through these links, customers are able to seamlessly purchase these products on our digital platforms. We further simplified the policy application process and shortened response times to allow our financial representatives to conduct their business and complete transactions with greater agility and speed, thus uplifting overall productivity.

Our holistic customer proposition and service offerings, including  end-to-end  professional  advisory,  wealth management solutions and priority processing, supported by our Prestige Client Office, allowed us to deepen our penetration in the affluent segment.

On the recruitment front, we stepped up by providing employment opportunities in the insurance sector by reaching out to fresh graduates and mid-career individuals. We conducted virtual Masterclass seminars where our top in-house practitioners shared useful tips with people seeking to make a career change. The success of our recruitment initiatives led to the growth of our representative network to over 5,000 at the end of 2020.

Aside from growing our people footprint, we accelerated our efforts on further strengthening our financial representatives' capabilities. We launched a series of topical training modules online for convenient access throughout the year. We continued to enrol more leaders in a 25-week Agency Management Training Course to achieve the Institute of Banking &amp; Finance (IBF) Level 3 accreditation.

We faced significant challenges in our bancassurance business during the first half of the year, but we saw a strong rebound in the second half of 2020. We worked with our bancassurance partner OCBC Bank to launch remote sales advisory capabilities to equip their sales network to better serve their customers' financial needs. As such, OCBC Bank was able to enrich its sales and engagements through digital, telesales and direct channels.

In 2020, we further strengthened our affinity partnerships to broaden our reach to new customer segments and address customer needs arising from their increasingly digital lifestyle and consumption habits. We worked in collaboration with telecommunications provider Singtel, harnessing their deep customer insights and platforms to launch contextual campaigns for home insurance solutions. With Singapore Press Holdings, we provided insurance for news tablets issued to its digital newspaper subscribers, while ActiveSG members could purchase our insurance solutions via its mobile app.

## GROWING OUR GENERAL AND GROUP INSURANCE BUSINESS

During the year, our General Insurance business demonstrated resilience, driven by our well established and diversified distribution network, focus on retail, and portfolio realignment. We remained steadfast in our effort to digitalise our business model.

With OCBC Bank, we developed relevant propositions to engage customers through its distribution touchpoints. We saw potential in extending our insurance products to its corporate customers, based on their increased interest in coverage for supply chain interruptions, physical assets and health protection for employees, due to the adverse economic environment.

Our Group Insurance business experienced good growth during the year, as a result of our strong relationships with our brokers and distribution partners, and an increased risk awareness among our customers. Our telemedicine solutions for corporate users, established since 2018, also positioned us well, as we saw wider adoption of contactless medical services and use of digital health platforms. We expanded the employee benefits schemes and grew our stable of telemedicine providers to meet the increase in demand from corporate users. By introducing home services for executive health screenings and influenza vaccinations, we were able to deliver greater convenience and safety to them as they continued working remotely.

## ENHANCING OUR PRODUCT PROPOSITIONS

In 2020, we rolled out innovative insurance solutions to provide comprehensive health-related protection, as well as savings and investment-linked plans.

In line with customers' heightened awareness of protection coverage, we redesigned the Great Flexi Protect series, our flagship series of critical illness whole life plans with the versatility to scale protection coverage and payouts. This enhancement empowered customers to curate critical illness plans that best address their needs. We launched GREAT Cancer Guard to provide coverage for all stages of cancer.

As one of Singapore's three approved insurers for CareShield Life  supplementary plans, we launched our long-term disability plans GREAT CareShield Enhanced and GREAT CareShield Advantage , aimed at enhancing protection for customers aged 30 and above.

Amid an increase in dengue cases in the country, we offered Great Value Protect with Dengue Fever coverage via online platforms for easy purchase. In addition, we bundled 12 months' complimentary Dengue Care coverage for new customers buying selected regular premium life, and accident and health insurance plans.

To support the protection-cum-wealth accumulation needs of our customers, we continued to improve our investmentlinked product offerings (ILPs). We enhanced GREAT Life Advantage , a comprehensive plan offering both protection and accumulation, with simplified underwriting and more choices of critical illness protection riders, as well as retrenchment waiver benefits to provide added assurance for customers. To enhance the wealth accumulation component of ILPs, we offered our customers access to Great Eastern-Lion Dynamic Funds, for those who want to tap on the expertise of our inhouse investment team to manage their ILPs.

During the year, our short-term endowment plan GREAT SP , supplemented with hospital cash cover and complimentary telehealth services as added benefits, was well-received by customers.

For  our  bancassurance  customers,  we  developed  a comprehensive ILP which featured a simplified application process. We rolled out a suite of products, including health, savings and term life protection plans, for customers to purchase online via OCBC Bank's digital and ecosystem platforms. In addition, our legacy solutions PremierLife Generation 3 and GreatLife Endowment , developed for the mass affluent, registered strong sales.

In October 2020, Great Eastern was appointed by the Central Provident Fund Board as the sole insurer for its enhanced Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS) that will be effective from 1 April 2021. We will now play a pivotal role in making insurance accessible to the working population in Singapore, and plan to offer a suite of value-added products and services to DPS members as they come onboard.

## DEEPENING CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT

Throughout 2020, we connected with our customers on digital platforms, expanding our online activities and building on our brand mission, particularly in the second half of the year.

Health and wellness remained a key pillar in our initiatives to encourage customers to partner with us in their journey towards good health. The FitAge feature was added to GETGREAT, our health and wellness app, to encourage people to track their fitness more holistically. We further boosted customer engagement through our mobile rewards app UPGREAT with more attractive online rewards in dining, lifestyle and shopping.

In the third quarter of 2020, we launched UPGREAT Virtual Vacay. This virtual travel and booking platform aims to address consumers' interest in travel via virtual overseas tours, customised staycation itineraries in Singapore, and provided promotional offers with travel partners.

We launched our Live #Lifeproof brand campaign in July, to reinforce our brand purpose to customers. Our Live #Lifeproof Financial Video Series in October helmed by our financial representatives encouraged customers to embark on better financial planning for health and retirement. We also celebrated our first #Lifeproof Virtual Challenge to replace the physical 15th edition of Great Eastern Women's Run in November.

To engage next-generation customers, we partnered with trending influencers in our #Lifeproof Next Gen webinar series which ran from August to December. This series aimed to impart life skills to fresh graduates and those new to the workforce in the areas of financial literacy and focused on helping them with professional competencies. We further conducted client webinars on investment, lifestyle, and health and wellness topics to keep them up-to-date on current topics and trends.

We additionally created a Life Hacks content microsite to engage potential new customers with interesting stories on how to best pursue financial freedom with early planning.

## DELIVERING QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE

During the year, we remained fully committed to providing continuous access to quality services across multiple touchpoints to address our customers' needs, with health and safety measures put in place.

We embarked on new initiatives and continued to invest heavily in technology to provide our customers with seamless access to our products and services.  From as early as February, customers could purchase a suite of selected products seamlessly online with MyInfo, which helped facilitate customer identification and auto-population of personal information with ease. Customers who made their purchases via our digital platforms could also receive post-sales servicing and advice from their assigned financial representatives.

To provide 24/7 accessibility to our services, we launched Great Eastern App to provide our customers with the convenience and visibility of their policies anytime, anywhere.  With this app, customers have the ability to make service requests directly on their mobile devices, and manage their policies.

Continuing with our efforts to enhance customer experience, we implemented corporate PayNow to allow customers to make premium payments conveniently on our E-Connect platform, and strengthened Health Connect to encourage our Integrated Shield customers to increase usage of our specialist panel for their healthcare needs. Additionally, we implemented the Predictive Underwriting Model for life and critical illness products which enabled us to serve our customers with greater speed and efficiency.

With COVID-19 impacting almost all areas of life in 2020, we continued to place our customers as our top priority with various initiatives introduced to support those impacted, while ensuring our customers' protection and financial needs were met.

To help our customers and their family members diagnosed with COVID-19, we pledged RM2 million through our Financial Assistance Programme and supported over 1,000 people. We further assisted approximately 1,470 policyholders to continue their insurance coverage by deferring their regular premium payments for three months.  We supported the COVID-19 Test Fund initiated by Malaysia's Ministry of Health by allowing each of our medical insurance policyholders and takaful certificate holders to apply for reimbursement up to a maximum of RM300 for COVID-19 testing. In addition, we instituted flexible premium payment schemes for our corporate customers whose businesses had been adversely impacted by COVID-19.

## OUR CONVENTIONAL LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS MAINTAINED LEADERSHIP POSITION

Despite challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial representative network displayed resilience and agility, adapting quickly to the new norm of sales advisory. We were quick to introduce a fully remote insurance sales advisory process, enabling our representatives to provide

uninterrupted advisory services to their customers via digital platforms. Our suite of guaranteed issuance offer products and affordable medical plans were well-timed to meet market demand.

To ensure we continue to uplift the professionalism of our representatives, our Centre for Excellence implemented a blended learning approach involving e-learning, virtual classroom training and webinars.  We conducted over 500 virtual classroom trainings for almost 32,000 participants.  At the same time, the Leadership Development Faculty delivered programmes to upskill our newly appointed agency leaders with technical competencies.

Throughout the year, it was equally important for us to stay connected with our representatives. We launched Great Events via Facebook to connect and share important updates with a closed group of over 10,600 representatives. In July, we hosted the largest webinar to engage and motivate our representatives.

Social media platforms were the key enablers helping to magnify our recruitment programmes to over 2.7 million people. We also organised physical and virtual employment workshops for graduating students to promote insurance as a career option.

Our bancassurance partner OCBC Bank implemented remote sales advisory, enabling its sales team to continue to engage and effectively service the customers. In addition, it launched a legacy customer campaign to promote legacy planning to customers, and a skills uplift programme for their sales network to improve productivity.

During the year, we deepened our affinity partnership with Axiata Digital. We offered customised segment-aligned insurance solutions via their digital platforms.

Our Group Insurance business also showed resilience as we continued to strengthen our engagement activities with policyholders and distribution partners, contributing to the growth in our business.

## Enhancing our customer propositions

In early 2020, we launched Great Generation Care , the first insurance plan in Malaysia to provide comprehensive critical illness protection for three generations in a family under a single plan, with complimentary critical illness/child illness coverage. The plan additionally offered an optional Parent Protect Rider with no medical underwriting required, covering the customer's parents against Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and Parkinson's disease.

We further strengthened our health solutions through our new offerings. We launched new investment-linked riders, namely, SmartMedic Million that provides comprehensive medical and hospitalisation benefits; and Smart Multi Critical Care that provides comprehensive critical illness coverage and special benefits for diabetes and mental illness, and encompasses multi-claim features.

Amid the implementation of movement restrictions and safe distancing measures, we offered a suite of affordable protection plans ( Great Love4U, Great 80 Care and Great Life Gift ) with simplified application process, with a simplified application process and no medical underwriting requirement.

In collaboration with Boost e-Wallet, we launched HospiCash , which offers hospital cash allowance; and Protect Super6 , providing accidental death, critical illness and bereavement benefits for adventure seekers. In November, we launched the first-ever redeemable insurance in Malaysia on the Boost app. Through its loyalty rewards programme, Boost users are able to purchase our protection plans using Boost Coins. One featured product under this initiative is LifeProtect , a life insurance plan providing additional financial assistance upon diagnosis of COVID-19.

## Deepening customer engagement digitally

We  launched  the  'Discover  Greatness'  to  engage with our customers and the community in August. The campaign aimed to encourage the community to live healthier and better, our customers to achieve financial security and prepare ahead for uncertainties, and our employees and financial representatives to realise their full potential with us.  Our campaign video generated almost 2 million views within 1.5 months.

To navigate the health journey of caring for ageing parents and to debunk myths about childhood vaccines, we organised a Great Wellness Webinar for our customers and the community. We collaborated with Pantai Hospital Ampang specialists to give talks on 'Caring Across Generations', where we promoted our insurance solution Great Generation Care .

In December, we launched UPGREAT Malaysia to drive greater digital engagement with customers, bringing them exclusive dining, lifestyle and shopping rewards seamlessly via the app.

## GROWING OUR TAKAFUL BUSINESS

In 2020, our Takaful business continued to deliver strong growth supported by our product offerings and the strength of our financial representative network.

We empowered our representatives to provide quality service and meet customers' needs more efficiently through the use of self-service portal, i-Great Partner.

Responding to increased concerns about job losses and pay cuts caused by COVID-19, we organised webinars featuring reputable speakers to motivate and inspire Malaysians, and to promote takaful as a viable career option.

To help support our bancatakaful business, we initiated webinars on financial planning towards building a resilient wealth portfolio for customers of selected bank partners.

## Enhancing our customer propositions

Our takaful solutions were well-received during the year as we continued to curate relevant products to meet customers' evolving needs.

In the first half of 2020, in view of heightened demand for protection, especially medical cover, we re-launched i-Great Harapan Plus and i-Great MediHarapan , a standalone medical plan, which saw strong take-up by customers.  Riding on strong market demands, we also launched i-Great Evo , a comprehensive plan which provides medical and critical illness protection, hospitalisation benefits and personal accident coverage; and i-Great Neo , a high coverage protection plan to help customers in retirement and legacy planning.

For our bancatakaful partner OCBC Al-Amin, we launched Family Gift-I , which offers protection benefits to immediate family members without additional medical underwriting requirements.

We also strengthened our product pipeline for affinity partners, offering segment-aligned insurance solutions via Axiata Digital's platforms.

Progressing in our mission to provide more people with protection solutions in Malaysia, we moved into our second year  as  the  takaful  operator  for  Malaysia's my Salam government scheme to deliver coverage to those in lower income households (B40).  We made strides in education and awareness through our kiosks at public and university hospitals across the country, and have seen a marked increase in the number of policyholders benefitting from this scheme in 2020.

## Strengthening our customer support and engagement

We have implemented several sustainable initiatives focused on operational efficiencies, and providing greater convenience for our customers by introducing more payment options such as e-payments.

To better serve customers' needs, we implemented GETCare app for our medical card customers. Through the app, our customers can conveniently access information relating to their medical coverage, such as the balance of their medical coverage limits and the list of panel hospitals near them.

We rolled out Great ID to provide convenient customer access to i-Get In Touch, our self-service online portal, which enabled them to seamlessly check their certificate details and claim status, and perform online transactions such as nominations, fund switches and payment mode changes.

Even as the government implemented movement restrictions and safe distancing measures, we were able to leverage our digital tools such as MPOS and GETsetGo to engage with our customers virtually, and our representatives were able to continue to support their protection needs.

## GROWING OUR GENERAL INSURANCE BUSINESS

Our General Insurance business remained resilient in the face of COVID-19, mainly driven by the growth in commercial business and our diversified distribution network. Despite the pandemic's severe impact on the demand for travel and motor sales, we maintained our focus on further strengthening our retail business through the launch of new products and deepening our affinity partnerships.

We worked in close collaboration with Axiata Digital to offer insurance solutions to complement their service offerings, and launched segment-aligned solutions via their digital platforms. Our partnership with Malindo Air to provide customers with easy access to travel insurance delivered reasonable performance, despite being impacted by the reduced demand for travel due to the pandemic.

## Enhancing our customer propositions

Curating protection solutions for young adults with active lifestyles, we launched EasiMed Active for those aged 40 years and below, which provides coverage for mental illnesses and optional benefits for outpatient chiropractic and injury sustained due to hazardous activities.

We expanded our motor offerings with add-on benefits such as the Inconvenient Car Courtesy allowance, which provides an allowance in the event of car breakdowns; Special Perils benefit for additional protection against unexpected natural disaster events; and Hospital Income allowance to provide an allowance in the event of hospitalisation due to vehicle accidents. We also enabled customers to purchase Flexi Transit Protection , which offers personal accident coverage via street parking payment solution app Flexi Parking. We  further  enhanced Great  Shield  Home to  include complimentary windstorm damage cover for selected outdoor fixtures and fittings, and offered two new chargeable options that provide coverage against accidental breakage of plate glass in buildings and increased limit of liability.

## INDONESIA

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the year 2020 started out as a challenging one for our Indonesia operations comprising Great Eastern Life Indonesia (GELI) and Great Eastern General Insurance (GEGI). However, we saw good recovery in the second half of the year.

Despite  challenges,  we  stayed  focused  on  providing customers' insurance needs, while prioritising health and safety. We responded swiftly to economic and operational challenges, and stepped up support to help our customers who were impacted by COVID-19 through our IDR10 billion Care Fund Programme.

Like other markets, we quickly adapted and redesigned our sales processes to ensure business continuity, and responded to our partners' and customers' needs and expectations. We were quick to pivot our online platforms to enable continued interactions and access to financial advisory services to fulfill our customers' insurance needs. The launch of digital signatures through Indonesia's government recognised Privy ID platform further facilitated seamless insurance transactions.

In June, we expanded our bancassurance distribution channel by strategically partnering with Bank Muamalat Indonesia to provide Shariah product Asuransi Great Hasanah Pembiayaan to their housing loan customers.

We enhanced our digital sales capabilities during the year to support our distribution network. Great Advice was launched to help them engage more effectively with customers, while Great Eastern Mobile Assistance, a new WhatsApp-based servicing channel, gave customers a wider range of remote service options, and GoGREAT! augmented the customer engagement experience.

To enhance our service offerings and reach new segments, we forged new strategic affinity partnerships. We partnered with Axiata Digital Services Indonesia to offer customised segment-aligned insurance solutions via its Boost and Aspirasi platforms. Together with leading technology-based insurtech firm Qoala and e-payment platform Linkaja, we collaborated to bring simple and affordable insurance solutions to the market. We launched a telehealth service with the YesDok mobile app for group insurance and individual customers who purchased Great Optima Link and Great Health Cover Rider.

During the year, we expanded our product offerings to holistically address our customers' protection and wealth management needs. This included Great Pro Assurance, Great Saver Assurance, Great ProInsure Hospital and Proteksi Diri. These products helped to drive positive sales momentum for both our affinity partners and bancassurance partner, Bank OCBC NISP.

In our General Insurance business, our focus on retail business and on strengthening relationships with local and international distribution partners contributed to the improved business performance in 2020.  During the year, we strengthened our bancassurance partnership with Bank OCBC NISP and built digital affinity networks.

In 2020, we focused on upgrading internal capabilities to provide an end-to-end digital journey for our financial representatives and customers, and to integrate our platforms with affinity partners via the API ecosystem. These upgrades will  enable  seamless  online  purchases  and  electronic endorsements, and provide ease of online claim submissions.

## BRUNEI

For the year 2020, we focused on ensuring that customers had uninterrupted access to our insurance solutions and professional financial advisory services in Brunei.  We implemented remote sales advisory to ensure our financial representatives could continuously engage customers, and strengthened our sales support.

Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, we put together a B$50,000 support package to help impacted customers and provided financial relief through the Deferment of Premium Payment programme for those affected during this challenging period.  At the same time, we included COVID-19 related medical and death claims in selected insurance products for customers.  Our new endowment plans GREAT SP , a single premium plan and Flexi Goal , a regular premium whole life plan, were well-received by customers.

During the year, we continued to strengthen the skillsets and product knowledge of our financial representative network. We conducted regular training sessions and activities to enhance their professionalism and advisory skills, and helped them build product competencies. We were able to continually connect with our financial representatives via online channels to keep them engaged throughout.

To grow our financial representative network, we launched the Agents of Life campaigns on social media channels and this garnered a good response.

![Image](output_md\Great Eastern - Annual Report 2020_artifacts\image_000073_53223a24091cdfb98b15f4e02cddd5bd7203f401d5fddb87ea325904525a1733.png)

While the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how we work, we have continued to actively pivot our strategies to ensure business continuity while keeping our employees safe and engaged. During the year, we kept our long-term focus on building a future-ready workforce and our commitment to create a supportive workplace where our employees thrive and are engaged.

## TRANSFORMING WORK PROCESSES

COVID-19 accelerated the digitalisation of our human resource processes to enable continuity in our operations to serve our customers. From early 2020, we implemented split operations starting in Singapore and progressively across our regional offices to safeguard the safety of our employees and manage operational risks. We expanded our IT infrastructure and capability to also enable work-from-home arrangements, with employees working remotely with the required tools and resources without compromising productivity.

We also digitalised other aspects including recruitment, where we implemented a seamless online experience from interviewing candidates through to contract-signing. In Malaysia, digitalised processes included performance management and talent management via a cloud-based technology system, to enhance operational efficiencies and to streamline the human capital processes.

In Indonesia, we set up the Human Resource Information System (HRIS) in October, which enabled employees to manage their human resource requests such as applying for leave and checking their leave balances and e-payslips. T o keep employees safe, we implemented an Intelligent Temperature Checking system to communicate information directly to HRIS for real-time tracking of employees' temperature readings and absences.

As part of our wider workplace transformation initiative, we started piloting flexi-work arrangements and correspondingly explored workspace redesign, to test a new future of work for employees in Singapore. We completed the pilot for a collaborative workspace on one office floor with video conference facilities, meeting rooms with wireless projection, open concept collaboration spaces for brainstorming, and flexi-workspaces. The pilot was put to the test during the year, and will foreseeably be rolled out to other regional offices progressively in 2021.

## ENGAGING EMPLOYEES

Despite the constraints on physical interactions due to COVID-19, we continuously engaged our people. To onboard new employees, we had a combination of e-learning modules and face-to-face orientation sessions with designated senior leaders, including career planning workshops in Singapore. Virtual orientations were held to onboard new employees at our regional offices.

In August, we celebrated our 112th anniversary in Singapore with a month-long campaign Life@112, a weekly workout challenge for employees to keep fit. We also conducted

other engagement activities such as virtual baking classes or mask-making workshops.

Our Indonesian offices, Great Eastern Life Indonesia and Great Eastern General Insurance Indonesia, celebrated their 24th and 26th anniversaries respectively, where all employees received a 'tumpeng', an Indonesian cone-shaped rice dish with side dishes of vegetables and meat delivered to their homes to thank them for their contributions to the company's success.

With a strong focus on organisational health and wellness throughout the year, we encouraged employees to own their wellness under the LIFE Programme. Since 2013, participation in this voluntary programme has grown by over 70% for employees in Singapore and Malaysia, and over 50% for Indonesia.

In Singapore, we distributed fruit and delivered speciallymade Great Eastern masks to all employees in July. In Malaysia, we distributed masks, organised a two-month Immunity Boosting and Hygiene Campaign in March to share immunity and hygiene tips, and also gave fruit and hand sanitisers to employees. In Indonesia, we prepared masks and hand sanitisers, as well as held a webinar series, 'Inspiring Wednesday', which covered topics such as mental wellness and enhancing virtual productivity for employees.

## INSTILLING VALUES AND DEVELOPING A FUTURE-READY WORKFORCE

## Integrity, Initiative and Involvement.

These are core values which we want to imbue in all our employees to live out at work every day. We launched our #mygreatculture programme to share actionable ways with employees, building on our foundational culture programme in 2019.

We introduced a set of Generic Skills and Competencies (GSCs) identifying soft skills such as Leadership, Exploring Possibilities and Decision-Making to embed a values-based ethos in our employees in 2020. Close to 95% of people managers participated in the managerial workshops and 100% of employees completed the e-learning module. These workshops and e-learning modules were also rolled out in Malaysia and will be progressively introduced across our offices in the region. To creatively engage and keep our values top-of-mind with employees, we created WhatsApp stickers, new lanyards and incorporated our three 'I's into the design of our new Great Eastern T-shirts across our markets.

Going forward, we will include the GSCs into our assessment tools to facilitate hiring and employee performance appraisals, so as to create a holistic programme to build the desired behavioural attributes in our workforce.

## GENERIC SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES

95% MANAGERS IN MANAGERIAL

100%

PARTICIPATION BY PEOPLE WORKSHOPS

E-LEARNING MODULE COMPLETION RATE

As a company that cares, we were fully committed to providing job opportunities for graduates and job seekers in 2020. In Singapore, we offered over 100 traineeship positions to graduates and internship opportunities for over 100 students, and recruited over 300 corporate staff who included midcareer individuals.

In spite of COVID-19, we continued to invest in people development by arranging 'on-the-go' and 'bite-sized' e-learning modules via LinkedIn Learning to drive continuous learning on digital platforms, workshops and webinars for employees to upskill so as to be future-ready. We organised a month-long #FutureReady Virtual Learning Carnival across all offices. We had an exciting line-up of 15 webinars with Google, KPMG, Facebook, Microsoft and others to cover topics such as Sustainability, Cybersecurity and InsureTech, for employees to have self-paced learning experiences.

We also introduced learning frameworks for employees to take up work-related courses to further develop their careers with us. Our Indonesian teams arranged training workshops and professional accredited courses in Risk Management and General Insurance for employees to enhance their professional competencies.

## SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS

We embraced sustainability in our human resource processes. Our October #FutureReady Virtual Learning Carnival was part of our wider effort to educate employees about sustainability and to encourage the adoption of sustainability practices. We introduced three webinars on this topic and are planning more on this front. To positively impact the environment, we will be digitising to eliminate paper usage to move towards becoming a sustainable company.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

GREAT EASTERN HOLDINGS LIMITED

BDEAY EASTERNLIFEASSURANCE

As a leading regional insurer and a responsible corporate citizen, Great Eastern is committed to making a difference in the communities where we operate. Even as we deliver our best to our customers, we strive to bring about positive and lasting changes in the communities through meaningful initiatives organised across the Group under Great Eastern Cares.

In 2020, many countries were greatly impacted by COVID-19. A key focus for us was to provide support to the needy and vulnerable who struggle with their daily needs. The pandemic also significantly impacted the types of activities that could be organised to reach out to the communities, within constraints of movement restrictions across Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, with most activities and fundraising efforts conducted through online channels.

As the pandemic eases and as countries gradually regain normality, we will strive to encourage active volunteerism among our employees and financial representatives to support the disadvantaged, and support health and wellness.

## SINGAPORE &amp; BRUNEI

COVID-19 escalated into a global pandemic at the start of 2020. In Singapore, we contributed S$200,000 to the Community Chest's Courage Fund to support vulnerable individuals and groups such as patients and healthcare workers.

![Image](output_md\Great Eastern - Annual Report 2020_artifacts\image_000075_d1f9866a5f67b577308c1596c562f619ab1b37264464e50eed1aa6e5c099023f.png)

Our employees and financial representatives additionally raised S$265,000 through the Great Eastern Cares Community Fund to bring relief to beneficiaries, particularly the elderly and low-income families, supported by AWWA, Care Corner Singapore and New Hope Community Services. We provided them with critical essentials such as hot meals, food supplies, medicine, hardship subsidies and shelter for the displaced.

While we were unable to hold our signature Great Eastern Women's Run (GEWR) due to COVID-19, we continued to help women in their health and wellness journey with curated fitness and healthy living content and tips on our social media platforms. From 1-8 November, we organised the first GEWR #Lifeproof Virtual Challenge where participants could select the 5 km, 10 km, 21.1 km or the popular Mummy + Me 2 km run with their daughters, share their results on our social media platforms and win attractive prizes. The virtual challenge was well received, especially by regular GEWR participants, and close to 300 submitted their entries.

To help the GEWR community and general public with their financial health, we launched the Live #Lifeproof Financial Video Series in October and November to provide tips on how they can better plan their finances. We covered topics such as how to safeguard your health, secure your child's future and how to retire comfortably.

In Brunei, our financial representatives and employees contributed funds to purchase gifts such as clothing, stationery and books, and delivered them to the young patients at YASKA Children's Cancer Foundation. In addition, we donated

B$10,000 to the Ministry of Health to build a therapeutic healing garden at a psychiatric centre in Kiarong to help patients during their recovery.

## MALAYSIA

To reduce the burden of rising food prices and necessities brought about by the pandemic, we donated AEON gift vouchers worth RM25,000 to 10 Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat (JKM) children's homes during Deepavali and Christmas for groceries and essential items. We also provided packed meals to five JKM children's homes during Christmas to spread the festive cheer. More than 560 underprivileged children benefitted from the two activities.

Responding to COVID-19, the company donated funds to purchase masks and personal hygiene items for school children from low-income families at Sekolah Rendah Agama Al-Alusi in Kuala Lumpur, and made a cash donation of RM10,000 to the elderly home Pertubuhan Kebajikan Orang Tua Cacat Dan Kurang Upaya Taman Connaught to support the home's utilities and rental, as well as provide the senior residents with masks and other daily essentials.

Strengthening our efforts to help the impoverished community in Kampung Orang Asli Sungai Gabong, we contributed 1,500 kg worth of essential household items such as cooking oil, rice, flour and personal hygiene items to the families in June. To enable the villagers to better support themselves, we engaged an expert from the local agriculture department to provide a talk on best farming practices.

We continued to support underprivileged children through Program Aspirasi Gemilang 'A' which was started in 2014, rewarding children who scored an 'A' grade in their national examinations with an incentive of RM100. The programme awarded RM7,700 to 54 children in 2020. To-date, we have awarded more than RM75,000 to children from underprivileged homes across Malaysia and motivated them to study hard and to do well in their examinations.

In addition, we donated RM10,000 to support patients who require palliative care through our participation in the Hospis Malaysia virtual run, and RM3,000 to Cancerlink Foundation to support cancer patients.

In recognition of our efforts to make a difference in the community, we received the Sustainability &amp; CSR Malaysia Awards 2020, which honours outstanding corporations in Malaysia that have excelled in the role of being change agents in the socio-economic transformation of Malaysia.

We also received the Corporate Social Responsibility award at the Malaysian Takaful Association's Annual Awards as well as the CSR Initiative of the Year Award at Insurance Asia Awards for our work with the Kampung Orang Asli Sungai Gabong community.

## INDONESIA

To raise funds for communities affected by the pandemic, we collaborated with our affinity partner, BookMyShow, to organise an online music concert 'Great Music for a Great Cause' in May. The concert featured the famous Indonesian singer, Rendy Pandugo. All donations were channelled to Indonesia Food Cycle Foundation to support those in need of food, such as street hawkers, the homeless and orphans.

We distributed over 6,000 T-shirts to 30 foundations and orphanages across eight cities in September and October, to provide the children with new clothing at a time when most foundations were receiving reduced support from donors and the wider community.

To improve the quality of life for the needy and disadvantaged, the company supported renovation projects for the Griya Werdha elderly home in Surabaya and Yayasan Tat Twam Asi orphanage in Bali. Apart from helping the homes with their repairs, we improved their living environment and facilities, and increased safety measures such as building secure fences for the safety of the residents.

Focusing on health and wellness, we conducted a series of online health and financial talks, as well as fitness sessions for employees of Bank OCBC NISP during the year. Close to 1,000 participants attended the 13 talks held throughout the year and topics included mental wellness, nutrition and financial planning, while over 300 participants joined fitness sessions such as body combat, yoga and zumba.

To support financial inclusion month in October, we partnered Qoala and Akseleran to organise an online financial literacy webinar for millennials. We also conducted insurance webinars for 70 women and youths from the Youth Association and Women Association in Batam, and for 100 students from SMA Pelita Kasih Makassar Senior High School to build awareness of financial planning.

## BOARD STATEMENT

2020 has been an unprecedented year. Despite the external challenges, we at Great Eastern seized the opportunity to build on our resilience and incorporate sustainability considerations in our business activities. It is during tough times that it is all the more important and meaningful to pursue our mission of making life great for our stakeholders by providing financial security, and promoting good health and meaningful relationships, as well as fulfilling our corporate social responsibility to the community.

## 2020, NEW SHARPENED FOCUS

This year we made significant strides on the sustainability front. We are now more focused in our sustainability approach,which is aimed at two sustainability objectives, namely, improving people's lives and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. At the same time, we have strengthened our sustainability governance by establishing  board  level  sustainability committee to oversee the Group-wide sustainability initiatives.

## SUSTAINABILITY DURING COVID-19

COVID-19 has heightened the need for us to speed up our digital and strategic priorities, in response to the threats and opportunities of the changing environment. Hence, we have accelerated several new initiatives to ensure operational viability  while  physical  contacts  among  people  were restricted, including adding digital distribution capabilities, and proactively engaging our customers to meet their needs.

Our efforts were targeted towards our four main stakeholders, which are customers, employees, financial representatives and the community at large. Details of these efforts can be found later in this report.

## DRIVING CHANGE FROM WITHIN

Fostering a culture of sustainability was an important undertaking for us in 2020. Several sustainability virtual learning  sessions  were  organized  for  our  employees throughout the year that touched on a breadth of related topics. These efforts helped to ensure that, regardless of job or rank, Great Eastern employees across the different entities have a common understanding of sustainability on personal as well as corporate level. To ingrain sustainability into our culture, we have adopted both a top-down and bottom-up approach. We have established a governance structure to indicate tone from the top and have also created avenues for employees to float their ideas on the sustainability initiatives to the management level.

Since 2018, we have been a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Sustainable Insurance (UNPSI) and we have been continuing our journey of building an insurance group that is environmentally conscious, socially responsible and ethical.

## LOOKING AHEAD

This is the beginning of our sustainability journey at Great Eastern. Together with the Group Management Team, the Board is committed to making increasingly meaningful contribution towards sustainability.

## SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

The Board provides oversight on the Group's sustainability efforts through the Board Sustainability Committee (SC) that was established in February 2020. The Group CEO provides the SC with regular updates on sustainability efforts and initiatives, as well as updates on global and local trends that may have an impact on the Group's direction and strategy in sustainability.

The Group Management Committee ('GMC') comprising of senior management from across the Group and chaired by the Group CEO, is responsible for the implementation of the Group's sustainability initiatives. Working groups comprising of representatives from business and support units undertake specific tasks and pursue new initiatives or projects to further our sustainability goals.

## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Creating value for our stakeholders to gain their support is crucial for Great Eastern. Regular  engagement with our different stakeholders gives us the opportunity to ensure alignment of our operations to their needs  and  interests.  Our  stakeholders are:  Customers,  Regulators,  Investors, Employees,  Community  partners  and Financial representatives.

## OUR MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS

Our Board considers the material ESG factors as part of its strategy formulation and decision-making. Hence, we regularly assess and identify material ESG factors that affect our business across all our operations. We have reviewed our sustainability approach this year, which has led us to reshape our sustainability pillars and material ESG factors. This reassessment has resulted in two key changes. Firstly, we have rationalised the number of material ESG factors from 10 to 7. Secondly, our commitment towards the material factor 'Robust Governance' includes Fair Dealing, Combating Financial Crimes and Cyber Security, and Customer Privacy.

We report our progress and performance on each material ESG factor in the following sections of this report.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## GREAT EASTERN'S RESPONSE TO COVID-19

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic along with governmentmandated movement restriction have impacted almost all areas of life. T o ensure that we provide uninterrupted services to customers, we accelerated a number of strategic initiatives to maintain service to customers on digital platforms. The key projects include ramping up our IT infrastructure to support for employees and financial representatives working from home to ensure operational continuity, launching tele-advice platforms to enable our financial representative to service our customers safely and introducing assistance programs for customers and members of community who have been financially impacted. See table on the next page for a more comprehensive description of our initiatives.

## SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS

To continue serving our customers remotely without physical meetings, remote advisory and servicing were introduced. We made available the types of servicing requests for policyholders to self-serve via the Great Eastern App and our E-Connect portal, such as change of personal particulars, premium apportionment and fund switches. To help customers, Great Eastern launched a S$1 million COVID-19 Customer Care Fund in Singapore and a RM 2 million Financial Assistance Programme in Malaysia, to provide hospitalisation and death benefits for our customers and their immediate family members. We also launched an interest-free COVID-19 Deferment of Payment Programme, an extension arrangement designed to help our policyholders to maintain their insurance protection during the economic downturn. A total of 3,400 policyholders have since benefited from these programmes across these markets.

To ensure that our customers had access to our insurance offerings and protection solutions, those who wanted to purchase them remotely could do so via our own digital platforms, but still have access to professional advisory post-sales servicing from our financial representatives.  In addition, we partnered with affinity partners such as Singtel and Active SG and e-commerce platforms such as Shopee, to further enable customer purchases through other channels.

## PROTECTING OUR EMPLOYEES AND FINANCIAL REPRESENTATIVES

Since the onset of COVID-19, we have implemented staggered work hours, split-operations mode of working and a Workfrom-Home (WFH) arrangement to ensure the safety of our workforce and continue providing quality service to customers, in addition, guidelines and safety measures were introduced onsite at our offices. A COVID-19 Agency Force Fund was established to provide our representatives and their families with quarantine, hospitalization and death benefits. As our financial representatives were not allowed to bring customers into the office, we conducted all meetings, trainings and sales advisory engagements virtually. We also simplified digital authorisation for policy purchases to enable quicker processing to help our financial representatives with their sales activities. Notwithstanding COVID-19, our financial representatives continue to be productive and responsive to customers, and generated positive sales and income during the challenging period.

## CONTRIBUTING TO OUR COMMUNITY

COVID-19 has taken its toll on economies resulting in job losses and dampened job prospects of many jobseekers. As a regional insurer and employer, we stepped up to offer 111 corporate roles under the SGUnited programme in 2020. We provide on the job training and help these trainees build work experience to prepare them for future opportunities. In Malaysia, we supported the government's COVID-19 Test Fund where medical insurance policyholders and Takaful certificate holders may apply for reimbursement of up to a maximum of RM300 for COVID-19 testing.

GREAT EASTERN HOLDINGS LIMITED

## MATERIAL FACTOR: RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT

## WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

As a leader in the industry with S$106.9 billion in assets under management, we are in a unique position to contribute to sustainability through Responsible Investment. A well-calibrated investment process that incorporates ESG considerations is expected to contribute towards long term sustainable economic development and better risk management for our investment portfolios.

![Image](output_md\Great Eastern - Annual Report 2020_artifacts\image_000104_c4e60ecd0950c0b6c924e819ed6bad19f1f292bb996fdee8bd3d92dc490c4eaa.png)

We embed ESG considerations into our investment analysis and decision making processes across all asset classes. We also advocate active ownership in our role as asset owners and investors to bring about positive change, through influencing companies and external fund managers to adopt ESG best practices.

In 2020, we intensified our ESG efforts, formally incorporating responsible investment considerations into our investment process, and accelerating Group-wide efforts in establishing climate-related reporting metrics for our portfolios. We have started to measure and monitor our portfolios' carbon footprint and intensity, which in time will allow us to set long-term reduction targets and mitigate risk arising from climate change. We have formalised our exclusion list to exclude investments in companies whose business practices are not aligned with our corporate values.

In Malaysia, we continue to invest in bonds that have been accorded Sustainability Ratings or Second Opinion Reports provided by accredited consultants. We also started work on monitoring the exposure of our loan and investment portfolios to climate-related risks, in line with guiding principles as set out in Bank Negara's Climate Change and Principle-based Taxonomy discussion paper.

## Lion Global Investors (LGI)

Our fund management subsidiary LGI became an UN-PRI signatory in January 2020. LGI has put in place a Responsible Investment policy and framework, which formally integrates ESG factors and considerations in its investment process.

LGI has completed the setting up of relevant data infrastructure and systems in measuring carbon emission and intensity across all of Great Eastern's Listed Equity portfolios, and will continue to explore the launch of suitable sustainability product offerings to add to its product suite.

LGI will also actively participate in various industry schemes to catalyse ideas and propel policy initiatives in the area of responsible investments.

## OUR TARGETS

- We continue to work on measuring portfolio carbon footprint across our Listed Equity portfolios, with a view to make our first disclosure in the 2021 Sustainability Report
- By 2023, to target to have 100% of appointed external managers having integrated ESG principles in their investment processes and ownership practices

## OUR PERFORMANCE

- Committed more than S$1 billion to ESG mandates to date
- More than 70% of assets in Singapore are managed by external managers who are UN-PRI signatories, and more than 90% by managers who have an ESG policy in place
- In  Malaysia, we increased our investment in bonds with Sustainability Ratings or Second Opinion report to S$ 109 million (RM 332 million). Meanwhile, our investment through UNPRI signatories stood at S$704 million (RM2.14 billion)

## MATERIAL FACTOR: ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT

## WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

As a financial institution, our operation has limited impact on the environment but we play our part to minimize our environmental impact on the planet by controlling what we use, how much we use and how we use in our operations. We also need to build operational resilience to withstand effects of climate change on our business and the communities in which we operate.

![Image](output_md\Great Eastern - Annual Report 2020_artifacts\image_000107_76f65ebf972b2bcb1deeb4f543f2aaba65bd945b64d71e51a48ecbd8dbbe771e.png)

We have focused our efforts on the following areas:

## Green Buildings

Initiatives undertaken in 2020, which are part of our multi-year continuing sustainability efforts, include:

- Upgrading our air-conditioning systems to energy efficient systems
- Replacing inefficient lightings with LED lightings
- Conducting a feasibility study to install renewable solar energy panels for our buildings in Singapore
- Commencing the process to obtain BCA Green Mark certification for two of our buildings in Singapore (Great Eastern @ Changi and Great Eastern House)

## Sustainable Procurement

We continuously reduce our usage of paper, and use only paper certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.

We aim to build reliable supply chains from suppliers that adopt sustainable practices through our new sustainable procurement practices.

- Eliminate the purchase of plastic bottled water in all Great Eastern offices by 2021
- Continue to reduce paper usage by 50% in 2023

## MEASUREMENT

Our objective is to reduce our carbon footprint over the years in support of the global efforts to transition to a low-carbon future. To achieve this, we are working on a methodology to measure our Scope 3 emissions with an aim to be able to track our carbon footprint and set realistic reduction targets in the future, particularly for our investment portfolios. As a financial service group, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our own operations remain low.

The largest contributor to our operational footprint is the electricity consumed by the buildings we own and use (Great Eastern corporate buildings in both Singapore and Malaysia, and commercial and residential buildings in Singapore). In 2020, our electricity usage reduced from 27.4 GWh in 2019 to 21.7 GWh in 2020.

The following depicts our energy, water and paper consumption in comparison with those in past years.

![Image](output_md\Great Eastern - Annual Report 2020_artifacts\image_000111_58eaf71e9ab3d7cb145da473dd5c61164becb1bfe975b811c8086a85227a87c0.png)

Starting in 2020, we expanded the tracking of our electricity and water consumption to include residential and commercial buildings in Malaysia and LGI office in Singapore.  The electricity usage, carbon emissions and water consumption for these properties were 12 GWh, 8,800 tCO2 and 116,836 m 3  respectively. The performance of these properties will be tracked going forward and included in our reports for future years.

The initiatives  undertaken  in  2020  that resulted in reduction of paper usage include:

- Transforming paper-centric processes to digital and electronic platforms (refer to our digital initiatives under Customer Engagement (described in page 72)
- Digitalising our human resource processes including our recruitment processes and filing of personnel information

## GREAT EASTERN CENTRE CUM NANKIN ROW

We embarked on the green property drive in 2018 starting with Great Eastern Centre and Nankin Row shophouses.

In this sustainability drive, Great Eastern Centre replaced its old chillers with a more efficient system. In addition, lightings in common areas such as car parks, stairwells, toilets and façade have been replaced with LED lighting. Motion sensors were used in toilets and stairwells. As a result, the electricity consumption has dropped 35% in 2020 from 4.6 GWh to 2.9 GWh. The energy intensity dropped from 126 kWh/ sq. m to 81 kWh/sq. m. This represents a drop in carbon footprint of 700 tonnes of CO2 emission.

While part of the reduction in electricity and water consumption in 2020 may be attributable to the reduced usage of offices because of COVID-19, our past investments in energy saving projects have also yielded significant results.

Due to our past efforts, Great Eastern Centre and Nankin Row were awarded Green Mark Platinum by BCA in November 2019. Continuing in 2020, we replaced all inefficient lightings with LED and installed a new cooling system to replace the oversized Water-Cooled package system for our server room.

## MATERIAL FACTOR: RIGHT PEOPLE (EMPLOYEES)

## MATERIAL FACTOR: ROBUST GOVERNANCE

## WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

We are in the business of providing customers' financial security and peace of mind. It is imperative that we manage our business prudently with high standard of corporate governance and integrity. Our employees and financial representatives deal with customers in a fair and ethical manner to ensure that our business practices gain the trust of customers and create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.

We have implemented several culture and conduct initiatives to support a strong and sound culture firmly founded on our core values. Our Group Culture and Conduct Governance Committee is tasked with the implementation of these initiatives to promote stronger governance. There is also a dedicated Board Risk Management Committee (RMC) that provides oversight on risk governance matters within the Group.

To promote a culture of robust governance across the Group, some of our key initiatives include:

## Code of Conduct

We have in place Code of Conduct that sets out the standards of ethics and professional behaviour expected of employees and financial representatives. We expect our people to carry out their duties to the best of their ability and with the highest standards of ethical conduct. Employees and financial representatives are also expected to display a high level of courtesy to safeguard customer and company interest during or outside their course of work and duties.

## Fair Dealing

Delivery of customers Fair Dealing outcomes is tied to the performance assessment of senior management.  This ensures that senior management takes the prioritisation of Fair Dealing practices seriously.

## Protection of Customer data

As an insurer with over 1.8 million customers, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers.

We have in place a Group Data Governance programme that sets the foundation where it highlights the principles and requirements of the Personal Data Protection Act that all staff and financial representatives are required to comply to ensure that our customers' data are well protected, and ensure that incidents are escalated and addressed promptly.

* DPTM is a voluntary enterprise-wide certification for organisations to demonstrate accountable data protection practices.
- # CBPR System was developed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) to build consumer, business and regulator trust in cross border flows of personal data. It assesses the organisation's data privacy policies against APEC Privacy Framework to ensure consistency.

## Cyber Security

We have in place cyber-risk management framework and policies to minimise business disruption to ensure continuity of customer service. We have established a comprehensive cyber security roadmap and maturity programme to drive the continuing improvement to our cyber defence against new and increasing threats.

Cyber criminals may try to infiltrate our defences through unsuspecting employees. Therefore, we have to increase awareness of cyber security through ongoing broadcasts to employees and financial representatives across the group as well as mandatory annual cyber security training. We conduct social engineering exercises to test the cyber security alertness of our employees and financial representatives.

For matters requiring approval, information furnished by  Management usually includes background explanatory information, relevant facts and/or analysis to support the proposal, implications  or  merits  of  the  case,  risk  analysis and  mitigating  strategies,  the  budget  (if  applicable) and Management's  recommendation.  The  senior management executives who can provide additional information  and  insight  or  provide  clarifications  to queries  raised  are  usually  present  at  the  meeting during  discussion  on  such  matters.  Occasionally, external  consultants  engaged  on  specific  projects may  also  be  invited  to  brief  the  Board  or  Board Committees,  where  relevant.  All  Board  and  Board Committee  members  have  unfettered  access  to information, which the Company is in possession of or has access to, for the purpose of carrying out their responsibilities.
53. Information  furnished  to  the  Board  on  an  on-going basis  includes  business  forecasts,  monthly  Group financials and  quarterly reports on  the financial results and performance of the Group and principal subsidiaries within the Group,  with explanations of  material  deviations  between  actual  results  and business  plans  and/or  budgets.

55. The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and  prepares  minutes  of  Board  proceedings.  She assists  the  Chairman  to  ensure  that  appropriate Board  procedures  are  followed  and  that  applicable regulations  are  complied  with.  Under  the  direction of  the  Chairman,  she  ensures  good  information flow  within  the  Board  and  Board  Committees,  and between  senior  management  executives  and  nonexecutive  Directors.  The  Company  Secretary  also facilitates the orientation of new  Directors and professional  development  of  Directors,  as  required. The  appointment  and  removal  of  the  Company Secretary is considered to be a matter for the Board as a whole.
56. The  Directors  may  take  independent  professional advice  as  and  when  necessary  to  enable  them  to discharge their duties effectively. Similarly, the Board and  Board  Committees  may  obtain  professional advice, whenever necessary and appropriate, so as to effectively  discharge  their  roles  and  responsibilities. All  engagements  of  external  advisers  are  at  the Company's expense.

## Board Orientation and Development

Upon the appointment of a new Director, the newlyappointed Director will be apprised of his/her statutory  and  fiduciary  duties  and  obligations  and issued a Director's orientation kit, which will include key  information  on  the  Company  and  the  Group, the  terms  of  reference  of  the  Board  and  Board Committees,  duties  and  obligations of Directors as  well  as  relevant  rules  and  regulations.  As  part of  the  induction  programme  for  new  Directors,  the Group CEO and senior management executives will conduct presentation sessions for new Directors on the  Group's  principal  activities,  strategic  plans  and business  operations  and  the  induction  programme will be tailored to the specific development needs of the new Directors. The Company constantly reviews and  improves  on  the  contents  of  such  briefings  to new Directors to take into account any new legislative changes  which  affect  the  roles  and  responsibilities of  Directors  and  to  enable  them  to  have  a  more comprehensive  understanding  of  the  Group,  the insurance  business  and  practices  and  the  Group's financial positions.
58. The  Nominating  Committee  ensures  that  there  is  a continuous professional development programme for all  Directors,  to  ensure  that  they  are  equipped  with the appropriate skills and knowledge to perform their roles on the Board and Board Committees effectively. The Company arranges for new Directors to be briefed on  areas  such  as  accounting,  risk  management, insurance  and  for  first-time  Directors  to  undergo training  in  roles  and  responsibilities  of  directors  of listed  companies  as  prescribed  by  the  SGX-ST. From  time  to  time,  the  Company  organises  talks, seminars or presentations by external professionals, consultants or Management on topics relevant to the insurance  industry,  relevant  new  laws,  regulations and changing commercial risks and provides updates on developments in the industry locally and in other developed  countries.  Industry-related  and  topical articles are regularly circulated to Directors as part of the Company's continuous development programmes for Directors.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

68. Mr Norman Ip, Mr Law Song Keng, Mr Lee Fook Sun and  Mr  Soon  Tit  Koon  are  non-executive  Directors of  companies  that  have  purchased  insurance  or provided reinsurance to the Company's subsidiaries. Such  business  transactions  have  been  conducted in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  on  an  arm's length  basis  and  on  reasonable  commercial  terms. The  Nominating  Committee  considers  them  to  be independent  of  business  relationships  as  they  are not  involved  in  the  day-to-day  conduct  of  these companies' businesses and is of the view that these business relationships do not affect their ability to act independently.
69. Mr Lee Fook Sun is the non-executive Chairman of companies that had business transactions with GEL, a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  in  the financial year ended 31 December 2020 ('FY2020'). The  contracts  awarded  to  these  companies  were in accordance with the Group's procurement policy.  Aggregated  payments  to  these  companies were  insignificant  compared  to  the  Group's  overall expenditure  in  the  relevant  field  for  FY2020.  As  Mr Lee  serves  in  a  non-executive  capacity  in  these companies, he would be substantially removed from the actual business transactions  between  these companies  and  GEL.  The  Nominating  Committee considers him to be independent of business relationships as he is not involved in the day-to-day conduct  of  those  companies'  businesses  and  is  of the  view  that  these  business  relationships  do  not affect his ability to act independently.
70. Under  the  CG  Regulations,  Mr  Koh  Beng  Seng  is deemed non-independent as he has served for more than nine years on the Board and he is a Director of the  Company's  substantial  shareholder,  OverseaChinese Banking Corporation Limited ('OCBC Bank'). The  Nominating  Committee  has  determined  that he  is  independent  from  management  and  business relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries.
71. Mr  Norman  Ip  is  deemed  non-independent  as  he has served for more than nine years on the Board. However,  he  is  independent  from  the  substantial shareholder of the Company, and management and business  relationships  with  the  Company  and  its subsidiaries.
72. Mr Wee Joo Yeow is a non-independent Director as he is a member of the Board of OCBC Bank and hence, under the CG Regulations, is not independent from the  substantial  shareholder  of  the  Company.  As  Mr Wee Joo Yeow is an independent Director of OCBC Bank,  he  has  been  determined  by  the  Nominating Committee  to  be  independent  from  management and business relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries.
73. Mr Samuel N. Tsien is a non-independent Director as he is the Group Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of OCBC Bank.
74. The  current  Board  complies  with  the  requirements on  Board  composition  and  Board  independence under the CG Regulations. Six out of the ten Board members  are  independent  Directors  and  all  Board members are non-executive Directors.
75. The Board, through its Nominating Committee, is  of  the  view  that  the  current  Board  and  Board Committees  are  of  an  appropriate  size  to  facilitate effective  decision-making,  taking  into  account  the scope and nature of the operations of the Company and the Group.
76. A  Board  Diversity  Policy,  setting  out  the  approach to diversify the appointment of members and composition  of the Board, is published on  the Company's website www.greateasternlife.com. In the appointment of Board members, the policy embraces the diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, including familiarity in the Company's core markets, age, gender and length of service, as well as merit and  independence.  Steps  are  taken  to  improve effectiveness, where necessary.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

77. The Company's Board members have diverse backgrounds,  experience  and  qualifications,  and bring  a  wide  range  of  commercial  and  financial experience  to  the  Board.  Collectively,  they  provide the necessary business acumen, knowledge, capabilities and core competencies to the Company and  the  Group,  including  industry  knowledge  in insurance (such as key products and customers) and actuarial science, investment and asset management (such  as  real  estate  and  property),  knowledge  in banking,  accounting,  finance,  strategy  formulation, management experience, risk management, technology,  transformation  management,  taxation, trust law, cyber security and familiarity with regulatory requirements. Several Directors also have experience  in  jurisdictions  outside  Singapore,  such as  Malaysia,  Indonesia  and  Greater  China.  At  least one of the independent Directors has experience in the  insurance  industry.  The  diversity  of  experience and competencies of the Directors enhance the  effectiveness  of  the  Board  in  discharging  its responsibilities. Female representation on the Board is currently 10%.
78. With the knowledge, objectivity and balance contributed by the non-executive Directors, the Board constructively  challenges  and  enhances  proposals on strategy, reviews the performance of Management against  agreed  goals  and  objectives,  and  monitors the reporting of performances.
79. The  non-executive  Directors  met  twice  during  the year without the presence of Management to discuss matters such as the performance and effectiveness of Management.

## Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

80. The  Chairman  and  the  Group  CEO  are  not  related to each other. The roles of the Chairman, Mr Koh  Beng  Seng,  and  the  Group  CEO,  Mr  Khor Hock Seng, are distinct and separate, with a clear  division  of  responsibilities  between  them  to ensure  an  appropriate  balance  of  power,  increased accountability and greater independence in decisionmaking. The Company has Board-approved internal guidelines  setting  out  the  scope  of  authority  of  the Chairman and the Group CEO.
81. The principal responsibilities of the Chairman include leading the Board to ensure it effectively discharges its  roles  and  responsibilities,  approving  agendas  of Board meetings, monitoring the quality and timeliness of  the  flow  of  information  from  Management  to  the Board and promoting effective communication with shareholders.  The  Chairman  also  facilitates  robust discussions  and  deliberations  in  Board  meetings, encourages constructive relations between the Board and Management, and promotes high standards of corporate governance with the full support of the other Directors, the Company Secretary and Management.
82. The Group CEO manages the Company and oversees the Group's operations and implementation of  the  Group's  strategies,  plans  and  policies  to achieve planned corporate performance and financial goals.  His  management of  the  Group's  businesses, including implementing the Board's decisions, is  carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  the  senior management  executives  of  the  Group.  Collectively, they  are  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operations and administration of the Company and the Group, ensuring, inter  alia ,  operational  and  organisational efficiency,  profitable  performance  of  the  operating units, regulatory compliance, good corporate governance  and  effective  risk  management.  The Board  establishes  the  performance  targets  of  the Group CEO and reviews his performance against the targets annually.
83. The  Board  has  not  appointed  a  Lead  Independent Director  as  the  Chairman  and  the  Group  CEO  are already  separate  persons,  are  not  related  to  each other  and  the  Chairman  is  not  involved  in  the  dayto-day  running  of  the  Company's  business  and operations. The Chairman is independent from management  and  business  relationships  with  the Company and its subsidiaries. He is also independent of the Management and performs an effective check and balance on the Management. The Board has a majority of independent Directors and the Directors are able to exercise  independent  and  objective judgment.  As  part  of  its  continuous  assessment of  corporate  governance  standards,  the  Board  will appoint a Lead Independent Director when the Board situation warrants it.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

## Principle 4: Board Membership

The Board has a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the Board.

## Process for appointment of new Directors

84. The Nominating Committee has a key role in carrying out the formal and transparent process established for the appointment  of  Directors to the  Board. Taking  into  account  the  competencies  and  skills required  by  the  Board,  the  Nominating  Committee establishes annually the profile required of the Board members, before making any recommendations on the appointment of new Directors, where necessary. The Nominating Committee may engage external  search  consultants  to  source  for  potential candidates. Proposals for the appointment of new  Directors are reviewed by the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee meets with short-listed candidates  to  assess  their  suitability and commitment. Competent individuals are nominated for Board approval after the Nominating Committee has assessed their suitability taking into consideration, amongst  others,  their professional qualifications, integrity, financial and commercial business experience and field of expertise relevant to the Group, potential to contribute to the effectiveness of the Board and to complement the skills, knowledge and expertise of the Board.
85. In addition, the Nominating Committee further determines the proposed candidate's independence under  the  CG  Regulations  and  ensures  that  the proposed candidate would satisfy the criteria under the  CG  Regulations  in  that  his/her  appointment would not result in non-compliance with any of the composition requirements for the Board and Board Committees, and that he/she is a fit and proper person for the office, taking into account his/her track record, age, experience, capabilities, skills and other relevant factors  as  may  be  determined  by  the  Nominating Committee. Such reviews are also conducted on an annual  basis  to  ensure  that  each  Director  remains qualified for the office based on the above criteria.

## Re-nomination and Re-election of Directors

86. All  Directors  of  the  Board  are  required  to  submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election at regular intervals, at least once every three years. At each AGM of the Company, one-third of the Directors, being those who have served longest in office since their  re-election,  are  required  to  retire  by  rotation in  accordance  with  the  Company's  Constitution. Pursuant to the Company's  Constitution, newly appointed  Directors  will  hold  office  until  the  next AGM  and,  if  eligible, can  stand  for re-election. Retiring  Directors  are  eligible  for  re-election  when re-nominated by the Nominating Committee, taking into account the Directors' attendance at meetings, their  expertise,  knowledge  and  commitment,  and their  contributions  to  Board  discussions  and  to  the effectiveness of the Board.
87. The Directors who are retiring by rotation under Article 97 of the Company's Constitution and standing for reelection at the 2021 AGM are Mr Norman Ip, Mr Lee Fook Sun and Mrs Teoh Lian Ee. Mr Samuel N. Tsien, who  is  retiring  under  Article  97  of  the  Company's Constitution,  will  not  be  seeking  re-election  as  a Director  of  the  Company.  Mr  Ng  Chee  Peng,  who will  be  appointed as a Director of the Company on 1  March  2021,  will  retire  under  Article  103  of  the Company's Constitution and stand for re-election at the 2021 AGM.
88. Directors are expected to set aside adequate time for their  oversight  of  matters  relating  to  the  Company. The  Directors  provide  declarations  of  changes  in their other appointments which are disseminated to all  Board  members.  The  Company  has  established guidelines  on  meeting  attendance  and  the  extent of  other  appointments  outside  the  Company  that  a Director may assume. Generally, a Director who has full-time  employment  in  any  organisation  may  have appointments  in  no  more  than  three  other  listed companies, while a Director who does not have any full-time employment may have appointments in no more  than  six  other  listed  companies.  Each  of  the Directors' listed company directorships and principal commitments are provided on Pages 18 to 28 under the section 'Board of Directors' of this Annual Report. The Nominating Committee annually assesses each  Director's  attendance  record  and  degree  of participation  at  meetings  to  determine  if  a  Director is  able  to  and  has  been  diligently  discharging  his/ her duties as a Director of the Company. All Directors have  met  the  requirements  under  the  Nominating Committee's guidelines.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

## Principle 5: Board Performance

## The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

89. The  Board  has  an  annual  performance  evaluation process, carried out by the Nominating Committee, to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  Board,  Board Committees and each Director's contributions. This annual assessment process consists principally of  evaluation  by  and  feedback  from  each  Director. Each  Director  evaluates  the  performance  of  the Board  and  Board  Committees.  The  assessment of  the  contributions  of  individual  Directors  to  the effectiveness of the Board is also performed annually. Such  assessments  are  made  against  established performance criteria consistent with those approved by the Board and used in the previous year.
90. An  external  party  is  engaged  every  three  years  to facilitate the Board evaluation process and to provide the  Board  with  an  independent  perspective  of  the Board's performance, including benchmarks against peer boards and industry best practices.
91. The  2020  Board  evaluation  questionnaire  focused on  areas  such  as  competency  and  independence, information quality and timeliness, conduct of meetings,  corporate  social  responsibility,  managing performance, succession planning, Directors' development, internal controls and risk management, and Board Committees. With regard to the individual Director's  assessment  criteria,  this  would  include attributes such as each Director's contribution, integrity, knowledge and abilities. The Board Chairman  and/or  Nominating  Committee  Chairman will act upon the feedback provided to enhance the Board's performance.
92. The purpose of the evaluation is to increase the overall effectiveness of the Board. The Board has found the evaluation  process  useful  and  constructive  since its  implementation  more  than  ten  years  ago.  This collective process has also provided an opportunity to  obtain  insightful  feedback  from  each  Director  on suggestions  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the Board.

## REMUNERATION MATTERS Principle 6: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies

The  Board  has  a  formal  and  transparent  procedure for developing policies on director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors and key management personnel. No  director  is  involved  in  deciding  his  or  her  own remuneration.

93. The objective of the Group's remuneration policy is to attract, motivate, reward and retain quality personnel.
94. In  considering  its  recommendations  to  the  Board and  in  approving  remuneration,  the  Remuneration Committee  ensures  that  remuneration  policies  are in  line  with  the  Group's  strategic  objectives  and corporate  values,  and  do  not  give  rise  to  conflicts between the objectives of the Company and interests of individual Directors and key executives.
95. The Remuneration Committee is tasked to review and recommend to the Board the general  remuneration framework  as  well  as  the  specific  remuneration for  each  Director  and  for  each  key  executive.  The composition  and  summary  terms  of  reference  of the Remuneration Committee are provided on Page 84  of  this  Annual  Report.  No  Director  is  involved in the deliberations regarding any  remuneration, compensation or any form of benefits to be granted to himself/herself.
96. The  Remuneration  Committee  members  are  wellversed  in  executive  compensation  matters,  given their extensive experience in senior corporate positions  and  major  appointments.  They  also  have access to  expert  advice  from  external  independent remuneration consultants, where necessary. The Remuneration  Committee  will  ensure  that  existing relationships,  if  any,  between  the  Company  and  its appointed  remuneration  consultants  will  not  affect the independence and objectivity of the remuneration consultants.
97. In 2020, Willis Towers Watson provided independent advisory services on the Group's executive compensation framework to ensure greater alignment of pay policies and practices with market and  regulatory  standards.  Willis  Towers  Watson  is not  related  to  the  Company  and  the  Company  is not  aware  of  any  business  or  personal  relationship between  Willis  Towers  Watson  and  the  Company's Directors and key management executives.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

98. The  Company  does  not  provide  any  termination, retirement and post-employment benefits to its key management personnel.

## Principle 7: Level and Mix of Remuneration

The  level  and  structure  of  remuneration  of  the  Board and  key  management  personnel  are  appropriate  and proportionate  to  the  sustained  performance  and  value creation of the company,  taking into account the strategic objectives of the company.

## Remuneration of non-executive Directors

99. The non-executive Directors are paid Directors' fees, which take into account factors such as the Directors' contributions, effort and  time spent,  attendance at  meetings  and  the  frequency  of  meetings,  the respective responsibilities of the Directors including the Board Committees on which they serve, market practices  and  the  need  to  pay  competitive  fees  to attract, retain and motivate Directors.
100. The  Remuneration  Committee  performs  an  annual review of the structure for Directors' fees and of the computation of the aggregate Directors' fees based on the earlier  Board-approved fee structure,  before recommending any proposed changes to the Board for  endorsement.  The  Directors'  fees  proposed  by the  Board  each  year  are  subject  to  shareholders' approval at the Company's AGM.
101. In its review of the non-executive Directors' remuneration, the Remuneration Committee can seek  expert  advice,  if  necessary.  No  consultant was  engaged  in  2020  to  provide  advice  on  the remuneration of non-executive Directors.
102. The Remuneration Committee has considered the  market  practices  for  non-executive  Directors' compensation  and, on its recommendation,  the Board has decided to use the same fee structure for computing the fee for each non-executive Director for FY2020 as that used in the previous financial year (in the following table):

|                                    |                                                                                      | Annual retainer   |

Attendance  fees  are  paid  to  non-executive  Directors  to recognise  their  contributions  and  time  spent  in  attending meetings.

## Remuneration policy in respect of Key Senior Management Executives

103. The  remuneration  of  the  Group  CEO  and  the  key senior  management  executives  who  report  directly to  the  Group  CEO  are  reviewed  annually  by  the Remuneration Committee, based on the overall remuneration framework approved by the Board.
104. In such annual reviews, the Remuneration Committee takes  into  consideration  factors  such  as  market competitiveness  and  market  benchmark,  and  that the  remuneration  is  commensurate  with  individual performance  and  contribution.  The  Remuneration Committee also takes into account the time horizon of risks, such as ensuring that all variable compensation payments shall not be fully paid over short periods when risks are realised over longer periods.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

105. As part of the Company's continuous efforts to create sustainable  value  for  stakeholders  through  broadbased  growth  across  its  core  markets,  delivering sustained  earnings,  driving  core  competencies  of disciplined  risk  management,  prudent  investment and continued upgrading of technology and people, and  ensuring  sustainable  business  practices,  the performance measures set for each business unit  embeds  these  objectives,  which  match  their functions  and  are  consistent  with  the  Group's  risk appetite.  In  determining  the  remuneration  of  key senior  management  executives,  risk  and  control indicators as well as audit findings and compliance issues are taken into account when assessing their overall performance, in addition to their achievement in  business  and  operation  performance.  Executives are remunerated based on the achievements of their own performance measures, and the demonstration of core values and competencies, while taking into  account  market  compensation  data  for  their respective job roles.

## Principle 8: Disclosure on Remuneration

## The company is transparent on its remuneration policies,  level  and  mix  of  remuneration,  the  procedure for setting remuneration, and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation.

106. To ensure that its remuneration packages are competitive,  the  Company  regularly  reviews  salary levels and benefits packages based on market data provided  by  recognised  consultants  who  conduct surveys on comparative groups in the financial sector. The determination of the Company's variable bonus pool is fully discretionary and the factors taken into consideration include financial and non-financial metrics such as the Company's performance, audit ratings, risk indicators and compliance issues, market conditions and competitive market practices.
107. The  total  compensation  packages  for  key  senior management executives comprise basic salary, various  performance  bonus,  allowances,  deferred share awards and benefits. The variable components have  been  designed  to  link  rewards  to  corporate and  individual  performance,  based  on  appropriate and  meaningful  performance  measures  set  up  by the  Company,  and  approved  by  the  Remuneration Committee and the Board.
108. The annual budget for salary increment and performance-related variable bonus, reviewed and  approved  by  the  Remuneration  Committee, is  submitted  to  the  Board  for  endorsement  and approval.
109. As a consequence of the financial crisis in recent years, financial  institutions  globally  have  been  reviewing compensation  practices  to  reduce  incentives  that encourage excessive risk taking. While the Company has adopted compensation practices that take into account the principles and implementation standards issued  by  the  Financial  Stability  Forum  for  Sound Compensation Practices, it also continues to review its compensation practices on an on-going basis to further ensure that decisions made are conducive for sustained business performance. In its deliberations, the Remuneration Committee also takes into account the remuneration principles, practices and standards that may be specified by MAS from time to time.
110. The  Company  has  identified  a  group  of  senior executives whose authorities and actions are deemed to have a major influence on the long term performance of the Company. This group, identified as 'Material Risk Takers' comprises the Group CEO and  his  direct  reports,  key  personnel  at  business units and senior control staff. Employees who are not senior staff but are identified as 'Material Risk Takers' are  also  included  in  this  group.  For  the  'Material Risk  Takers'  with  performance  bonuses  exceeding $100,000 in Singapore, at least  40% of their  entire bonuses are deferred in the form of shares.

## Share-based incentives

111. The Company does not have any share option scheme or share plan in place. Instead, the Company's holding company, OCBC Bank, grants share awards pursuant to the OCBC Deferred Share Plan to selected senior executives of the Group, based on recommendations of the Remuneration Committee. The Company has ceased  granting  OCBC  share  options  to  eligible executives  with  effect  from  FY2019  for  FY2018 performance.
112. Details of the share options (granted previously) and the award of deferred shares to the Company's eligible executives are disclosed in the financial statements. Further details of the above share option scheme and share plan are set out in Note 29 of the Notes to the Financial  Statements  and  in  OCBC  Bank's  Annual Report.
113. All  grants  and  awards  are  subject  to  cancellation and  clawback  if  it  is  determined  that  they  were made on the basis of materially inaccurate financial statements  and/or  the  employee  has  engaged  in conduct  that  results  in  financial  loss,  reputational harm, restatement of financial results and/or adverse changes of the Company's risk profile/rating.

## Remuneration of Top Five Key Management Personnel in 2020

115. The Code recommends the disclosure of the individual remuneration of the Company's top five key management  personnel  as  well  as  their  aggregate remuneration. The Board has considered this matter carefully and has decided against such a disclosure for  the  time  being  as  it  is  not  a  standard  business practice to do so, having taken into account the highly competitive conditions for talent in the industry.

## Remuneration of Immediate Family of Directors / Group CEO / Substantial Shareholder

116. None  of  the  Directors  or  the  Group  CEO  of  the Company  had immediate family members who were  employees  of  the  Company  in  2020.  As  the Company's substantial shareholder, OCBC Bank, is not an individual, the disclosure on remuneration of employees who are immediate family of substantial shareholders is not applicable.

## ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

## Principle 9: Risk Management and Internal Controls

The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

117. The  Board  is  responsible  for  the  governance  of risk.  It  sets  the  tone  for  the  Company's  risk  culture and monitors, through the Risk Management Committee,  the  effectiveness  and  adequacy  of  the risk  management  processes  and  systems  of  the Company and  its  principal  subsidiaries.  The  Board approves  the Company's  risk  appetite  and  has oversight  of  the  risk  activities  to  ensure  that  the Company's  strategic  intent,  operating  environment, internal  control  mechanisms  and  capital  sufficiency are consistent with the Company's risk appetite and regulatory standards. Further details of the Enterprise Risk  Management  Framework  implemented  by  the Company are set out in Note 33 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

118. The Board of Directors emphasises the importance of  institutionalising  a  strong  risk  culture  within  the Company. As a subset of the broader organisational culture, a strong risk culture supports appropriate risk awareness, bolsters effective risk management and promotes sound risk taking to ensure the Company's risk profile remains within its risk appetite. The Board also approves the risk culture principles and, along with  it,  the  set  of  desired  risk  culture  behaviours to  support  the  target  risk  culture  throughout  the Company.

## Accountability

119. The Company has in place a process for Management to  represent  to  the  Board  on  the  integrity  of  the Company's and the Group's financial statement and internal control system in relation to the requirement under the listing manual of the SGX-ST for the Board to  issue  an  assurance  statement  that  accompanies the Company's announcements of its interim and full year financial results. Following Singapore Exchange Regulation's removal of mandatory quarterly reporting from 7 February 2020,  the  Company provided  abridged  financial  disclosures  for  its  first and  third  quarters  for  FY2020.  These  disclosures supplemented the mandatory reporting of its half year and full year financial statements.
120. The  Board  is  kept  apprised  of  material  changes  in legislations  and  regulatory  requirements,  including requirements  under  the  listing  manual  of  the  SGXST. The Board takes necessary steps to ensure that the  Company complies with these requirements. In compliance  with  the  SGX-ST  Listing  Rule  720(1), the  Company  has  procured  undertakings  from  its Directors  and  key  executive  officers  in  the  form prescribed by the SGX-ST.
121. To  keep  Board  members  informed  and  updated, Management provides the Board with monthly financial  updates  on  the  performance  and  position of  the  Group.  The  Board  is  also  updated  on  any significant events that have occurred or affected the industry during the year.

## Internal Controls

122. The  Board  is responsible for ensuring that the Company's system of internal controls is adequate to safeguard shareholders' interests and the Company's assets. The Company has in place, self-assessment processes for  all  business  units  to  assess  the  adequacy and  effectiveness  of  their  systems  and  processes of  internal  controls,  and  their  level  of  compliance with  applicable  rules  and  regulations.  The  results of  evaluations  are  reviewed  by  senior  management executives. The Board has received assurance from the Group CEO (which includes assurance provided by key management personnel to the Group CEO) on the effectiveness of the Company's risk management and internal control systems. The Board also received assurance from the Group CEO and Group CFO that the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Company's operations and financial position.
123. Based  on  the internal controls established  and maintained  by  the  Group,  work  performed  by  the internal and external auditors, and reviews performed by  Management  and  various  Board  Committees, the  Board,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Audit  and Risk  Management  Committees,  is  of  the  view  that the  system  of  internal  controls,  including  financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls as well as risk management systems, were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2020, to address the risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations.
124. The system of internal controls provides reasonable, but  not  absolute,  assurance  that  the  Group  will not  be  adversely  affected  by  any  event  that  could be  reasonably  foreseen  as  it  strives  to  achieve  its business objectives. However, the Board also notes that  no  system  of  internal  controls  can  provide absolute assurance in this regard, or absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor  judgment  in  decision-making,  human  error, losses, fraud or other irregularities.

139. Pursuant  to  the  COVID-19  (Temporary  Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for Companies,  Variable  Capital  Companies,  Business Trusts,  Unit  Trusts  and  Debenture  Holders)  Order 2020,  the  Company  adjourned  and  held  its  AGM (originally scheduled to be held on 15 April 2020) by way of electronic means on 14 May 2020. The notice of  the  adjourned AGM, new proxy form and details of  the  alternative  arrangements  for  the  adjourned AGM  were  published  via  SGXNET  and  were  also made  available  on  the  Company's  website.  Due to the Covid-19  restriction  orders  in  Singapore, shareholders were not able to attend the adjourned AGM in person. Shareholders participated by observing and/or listening to the proceedings of the AGM via live audio-visual webcast or live audio-only stream  and  their  questions  were  submitted  to  the Company in advance of the adjourned AGM.
140. The Company's Constitution provides that shareholders may appoint not more than two proxies to attend and speak at the Company's AGM and/or  EGM  and  to  vote  in  their  stead.  Relevant intermediaries (which  has  the  meaning  ascribed to it  in  Section  181  of  the  Companies Act (Chapter 50))  may  appoint  more  than  two  proxies  to  attend, speak and vote at the Company's AGM and/or EGM. This will  enable  indirect  investors,  including  Central Provident  Fund  Board's  investors  to  be  appointed as proxies to participate at general meetings. To ensure authenticity of shareholder identity and  other  related  security  issues,  the  Company currently does not allow voting in absentia by mail, email or fax. Pursuant to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for Companies,  Variable  Capital  Companies,  Business Trusts,  Unit  Trusts  and  Debenture  Holders)  Order 2020, voting at the adjourned AGM in 2020 was by proxy only. Shareholders who wished to exercise their voting  rights  at  the  adjourned  AGM  appointed  the Chairman of the AGM as their proxy by completing and submitting the proxy form 72 hours before the time for holding the adjourned AGM.
141. Since 2012, the Company has conducted electronic poll  voting  for  all  resolutions  passed  at  the  AGM, for greater transparency in the voting process. Shareholders  are  informed  of  the  rules,  including voting  procedures  that  govern  the  proceedings  of general  meetings  of  shareholders.  Detailed  results of  the  votes,  showing the number of votes cast for and  against each  resolution and  the respective percentages,  are  instantaneously  displayed  at  the Company's  AGM  and  subsequently  announced  via SGXNET on the same day. An independent scrutineer is engaged to review the voting process and address shareholders' queries on the voting procedures.
142. For  the  Company's  AGM,  separate  resolutions  are set out on distinct issues, such as the proposed reelection  of  Directors,  proposed  Directors'  fees  and recommendation of final dividend. For the Company's EGM, the proposed corporate action or transaction, as applicable, and the rationale and other pertinent details  for  such  proposal  are  set  out  in  a  separate circular to shareholders, with the proposed resolution set out for approval by shareholders at the EGM. The Company does not 'bundle' resolutions, unless the resolutions  are  interdependent  and  linked  so  as  to form one significant proposal.
143. At the Company's previous AGMs, the Chairman and Directors, the chairpersons of all Board Committees, Group CEO, Management and the Company's professional advisers would be present and available to  address  queries  from  shareholders.  The  external auditor would  also be present to address any shareholders' queries about the conduct of the audit and  the  preparation  and  content  of  the  auditor's report.  At  the  Company's  2020  AGM  which  was conducted via electronic means, the Chairman and Directors, the chairpersons of all Board Committees, Group CEO, Management and the Company's professional advisers and external auditor were either present in person or attended via electronic means.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Members of Great Eastern Holdings Limited

## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## OUR OPINION

In  our  opinion,  the  accompanying consolidated financial statements of Great Eastern Holdings Limited ('the Company') and its subsidiaries ('the Group'), the balance sheet and the statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 ('the Act') and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) ('SFRS(I)s') so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2020 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## What we have audited

The financial statements of the Company and the Group comprise:

- the consolidated profit or loss statement of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020;
- the consolidated statement of comprehensive income   of the Group for the year then ended;
- the balance sheets of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2020;
- the statements of changes in equity of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended;
- the consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended; and
- the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

## BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing ('SSAs'). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Independence

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities ('ACRA Code') together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.

To the Members of Great Eastern Holdings Limited

## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## OTHER MATTER

The financial statements for the preceding financial year were reported on by an audit firm other than PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The auditor's report dated 18 February 2020 issued by the predecessor audit firm on the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 was unqualified.

## OUR AUDIT APPROACH

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the accompanying financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgments; for example, in respect of  significant  accounting  estimates  that  involved  making  assumptions  and  considering  future  events  that  are  inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We carried out these procedures by applying our industry knowledge and experience and assessed whether the methodologies and changes to those methodologies are consistent with recognised actuarial practices and expectations derived from market experience; |

| Management's valuation of life insurance contract liabilities uses complex actuarial methods and models. The valuation process involves significant judgment about the assumptions of uncertain future events, including: mortality, morbidity, expense, lapse, surrender and interest rates. In addition to historical experience, management judgment is involved in the application of these assumptions. Changes in these assumptions used could result in a material impact to the valuation of the life insurance contract liabilities and the related movements in the consolidated profit or loss statement of the Group. | • We performed an independent review of model points on a sample basis to assess that the methodologies and assumptions have been applied appropriately; • We assessed the reasonableness of the key assumptions used by management including: mortality, morbidity, expense, lapse, surrender and interest rates, by comparing against the Group's historical experiences and market observable data, where applicable; • We reviewed the reasonableness of the movement analysis of the insurance contract liabilities prepared by management. The movement analysis provides a reconciliation of the balance as at 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020, showing the key drivers of the changes during the year; and • We assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the financial statements. Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we found the methodologies and assumptions used by management to be appropriate. Our audit procedures on the disclosures showed that they were in accordance with the relevant SFRS(I) disclosure requirements. |

## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## OUR AUDIT APPROACH (CONTINUED)

Key Audit Matters (continued)

## Key Audit Matter

## Valuation  of  provision  for  current  income  tax and deferred tax (continued)

As at 31 December 2020, the Group has recognised  a  current  income  tax  payable  of S$225.5 million and net deferred tax liabilities of S$1,484.6 million.

The  Group  operates  in  various  countries  and  is subject  to  income  taxes  in  those  jurisdictions. There  is  an  inherent  uncertainty  involved  in  the calculation of current income tax and deferred tax. There are significant open tax positions. The final tax outcome determined by the tax authority may be  different  from  the  amounts  initially  recorded, resulting in changes in the tax provisions made in prior periods.

## OTHER INFORMATION

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Statement, Sustainability Report and List of Major Properties (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and the other sections of the annual report ('the Other Sections'), which are expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter

- We  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  disclosures  in  the financial statements.

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we found management's  assessment  of  the  current  income  tax  payable  and net deferred tax liabilities is reasonable. Our audit procedures on the disclosures  showed  that  they  were  in  accordance  with  the  relevant SFRS(I) disclosure requirements.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Members of Great Eastern Holdings Limited

## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to  provide  a  reasonable  assurance  that  assets  are  safeguarded  against  loss  from  unauthorised  use  or  disposition;  and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SSAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We  also  provide  the  directors  with  a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical  requirements  regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations  incorporated  in  Singapore  of  which  we  are  the  auditors  have  been  properly  kept  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Hans Koopmans.

Joint Venture

The Directors expect that the adoption of the new standards above will not have any material impact on the financial statements in the year of initial application, except as below.

## SFRS(I) 17 Insurance Contracts

SFRS(I)  17  was  issued  in  March  2018  as  replacement  for  SFRS(I)  4  Insurance  Contracts.  The  Accounting Standards Council Singapore ('ASC') has issued Amendments to SFRS(I) 17 on 27 November 2020 to defer the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.

It is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. SFRS(I) 17 requires a general model where estimates are re-measured in each reporting period. Contracts are measured using the building blocks of:

- discounted probability-weighted cash flows;
- an explicit risk adjustment; and
- a contractual service margin representing the unearned profit of the contract which is recognised as revenue over the coverage period.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.2 Changes in Accounting Policies (continued)

## 2.2.2 SFRS(I) not yet effective (continued)

The general model is supplemented by:

- a simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short duration contracts; and
- a modification of the general measurement model (the variable fee approach) for contracts with direct participation features.

SFRS(I)  17  is  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2023,  with  comparative  figures required. Retrospective application is required. However, if full retrospective application for a group of insurance contracts is impracticable, then the entity is required to choose either a modified retrospective approach or a fair value approach. The Group plans to adopt SFRS(I) 17 on the required effective date and a Project Steering Committee was formed to oversee the implementation of the standard. The Group expects that SFRS(I) 17 will result in an important change to the accounting policies for insurance contract liabilities of the Group and is likely to have a significant impact on profit and total equity together with the Group's financial statements' presentation and disclosures.

## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform ('IBOR') - Phase 2

The amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39, SFRS(I) 7, SFRS(I) 4, SFRS(I) 16 was issued in November 2020 by the ASC to address issues that arise during the reform of an interest rate benchmark rate, including the replacement of one benchmark rate with an alternative one.

The key reliefs provided by the Phase 2 amendments are as follows:

- Changes to contractual cash flow: When changing the basis for determining contractual cash flows for financial assets and liabilities (including lease liabilities), the reliefs have the effect that the changes that are required by an interest rate benchmark reform (that is, are necessary as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and are economically equivalent) will not result in an immediate gain or loss in the income statement.
- Hedge accounting: The hedge accounting reliefs will allow most SFRS(I) 9 hedge relationships that are directly affected by IBOR reform to continue. However, additional ineffectiveness might need to be recorded.

The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The Group is in the process of identifying the financial instruments that are affected, and working with the companies on making IBOR-related amendments to contracts.

2020

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.3 Basis of Consolidation and Business Combinations

## 2.3.1 Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances, except for insurance contract liabilities (note 2.10). A list of the Company's significant subsidiaries is shown in Note 3.

All  intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

- -De-recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost;
- -De-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;
- -De-recognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;
- -Recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
- -Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
- -Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;
- -Re-classifies the Group's share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.3 Basis of Consolidation and Business Combinations (continued)

## 2.3.2 Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and financial liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in profit or loss.

On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest at fair value, or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by another SFRS(I).

Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The accounting policy for goodwill is set out in Note 2.22. In instances where the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised as gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date.

## 2.4 Subsidiaries

A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment losses, if any.

## 2.5 Structured Entities

A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control and is generally established for a narrow and well-defined objective.

For the purpose of disclosure, the Group would be considered to sponsor a structured entity if it has a key role in establishing the structured entity or its name appears in the overall structure of the structured entity.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.6

## Joint Arrangements

A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

A joint arrangement is classified either as joint operation or joint venture, based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement.

To the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint operation. To the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint venture.

The Group recognises its interests in a joint venture as an investment and accounts for the investment using the equity method. The accounting policy for investment in a joint venture is set out in Note 2.7.

## 2.7 Associates and Joint Ventures

Associates are entities over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies.

The Group accounts for its investment in associates and joint ventures using the equity method from the date on which it becomes an associate or joint venture. If the investment in an associate is held by, or is held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds, the Group may elect to measure that investment at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with SFRS(I) 9. The Group will make this election separately for each associate, at initial recognition of the associate or joint venture.

On acquisition of the investment, an excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the entity's share of the associate or joint venture's profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

Under the equity method, investments in associates or joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associates or joint ventures. The profit or loss reflects the share of results of operations of the associates or joint ventures. Distributions received from joint ventures or associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Where there has been a change recognised in other comprehensive income by the associates or joint ventures, the Group recognises its share of such changes in other comprehensive income. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates or joint ventures.

When the Group's share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.

After  application  of  the  equity  method,  the  Group  determines  whether  it  is  necessary  to  recognise  an  additional impairment loss on the Group's investment in its associates or joint ventures. The Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in an associate or joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and the respective carrying value and recognises the amount in the profit or loss.

The financial  statements  of  the  associates  and  joint  ventures  are  prepared  as  of  the  same  reporting  date  as  the Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.7 Associates and Joint Ventures (continued)

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures the retained investment at fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the aggregate of the retained interest and proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity method was discontinued is recognised in profit or loss.

If the Group's ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture is reduced, but the Group continues to apply the equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.

## 2.8 Transactions with Non-Controlling Interests

Non-controlling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to shareholders of the Company, and is presented separately in the Consolidated Profit or Loss Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from Shareholders' Equity. An exception to this occurs when non-controlling interests arise through minority unit holders' interest in consolidated investment funds, when they are recognised as a liability, reflecting the net assets of the consolidated entity. These interests qualify as a financial liability as they give the holder the right to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash. Changes in these liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Profit or Loss Statement as expenses.

Changes in the Company's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.

## 2.9 Foreign Currency Conversion and Translation

## 2.9.1 Functional and Presentation Currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars, which is also the Company's functional and presentation currency.

## 2.9.2 Transactions and Balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated  at  the  rate  of  exchange  ruling  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  Non-monetary  items  that  are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the end of the reporting period are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement except for exchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the Group's net investment in foreign operations, which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve in equity. The foreign currency translation reserve is reclassified from equity to profit or loss of the Group on disposal of the foreign operation. Exchange differences on items such as equity investments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets are included in the fair value reserve in equity.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.9 Foreign Currency Conversion and Translation (continued)

## 2.9.3 Consolidated Financial Statements

For consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Singapore Dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. The Profit or Loss Statement is translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising from the translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as foreign currency translation reserve.

On  disposal  of  a  foreign  operation,  the  cumulative  amount  of  exchange  differences  recognised  in  other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement as gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

In the case of a partial disposal without loss of control of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interest and is not recognised in Profit or Loss Statement. For partial disposals of associates or jointly controlled entities  that  are  foreign  operations,  the  proportionate  share  of  the  accumulated  exchange  differences  is reclassified to the Profit or Loss Statement.

## 2.10 INSURANCE CONTRACTS

## 2.10.1 Product Classification

Insurance contracts are those contracts where the Group (the insurer) has accepted significant insurance risk from the policyholders by agreeing to compensate the policyholders if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholders. As a general guideline, the Group determines whether it has significant insurance risk, by comparing benefits paid with benefits payable if the insured event did not occur. Insurance contracts can also transfer financial risk.

Investment contracts are contracts that may transfer financial risk but do not transfer significant insurance risk. Financial risk is the risk of a possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of price or rates, credit rating or credit index or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.

Once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, it remains an insurance contract for the remainder of its lifetime, even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this period, unless all rights and obligations are extinguished or expired.

Insurance  and  investment  contracts  are  further  classified  as  being  either  with  or  without  discretionary participating features ('DPF'). DPF is a contractual right to receive, as a supplement to guaranteed benefits, additional benefits that are:

- Likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;
- Whose amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the issuer; and contractually based on the:
- Performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract,
- Realised and/or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer, or
- The profit or loss of the company, fund or other entity that issues the contract.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.10

## Insurance Contracts (continued)

## 2.10.1 Product Classification (continued)

For financial options and guarantees which are not closely related to the host insurance contract with DPF , bifurcation is required to measure these embedded derivatives separately at fair value through the Profit or Loss Statement. However, bifurcation is not required if the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract with DPF, or if the host insurance contract itself is measured at fair value through the Profit or Loss Statement.

For the purpose of SFRS(I) 4, the Group adopts maximum policy benefits as the proxy for insurance risk and cash surrender value or discounted maturity value as the proxy for realisable value of the insurance contract. The  Group  defines  insurance  risk  to  be  significant  when  the  ratio  of  the  insurance  risk  over  the  deposit component is not less than 105% of the deposit component at inception of the insurance contract. Based on this definition, all policy contracts issued by insurance subsidiaries within the Group are considered insurance contracts as at the balance sheet date.

The insurance subsidiaries within the Group write insurance contracts in accordance with the local Insurance Regulations prevailing in the jurisdictions in which the insurance subsidiaries operate.

## 2.10.2 Types of Insurance Contracts

Insurance contract liabilities are classified into principal components as follows:

- (a) Life Insurance contract liabilities; comprising
- -Participating Fund contract liabilities;
- -Non-Participating Fund contract liabilities; and
- -Investment Linked Fund contract liabilities.
- (b) Non-life Insurance contract liabilities.
- (c) Reinsurance contracts.

## 2.10.3 Life Insurance Contract Liabilities

Insurance contracts are recognised and measured in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective contracts and are based on guidelines laid down by the respective insurance regulations. Premiums, claims and benefit payments, acquisition and management expenses and valuation of future policy benefit payments or premium reserves as the case may be, are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement.

The valuation of insurance contract liabilities is determined according to the Insurance Regulations:

- (a) Singapore Insurance Act (Chapter 142), Insurance (Valuation and Capital) Regulations 2004 for insurance funds regulated in Singapore ('MAS Regulations'); and
- (b) Risk-Based Capital Framework for Insurers for insurance funds regulated in Malaysia.

Life insurance contract liabilities are recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged. These liabilities are measured by using the gross premium valuation method. The liability is determined as the sum of the present value of future guaranteed and, where relevant, appropriate level of non-guaranteed benefits and expenses, less the present value of future gross considerations arising from the policy discounted at the appropriate discount rate. The liability is based on best estimate assumptions and with due regard to significant recent experience. An appropriate risk margin allowance for adverse deviation from expected experience is made in the valuation of non-participating life policies, the guaranteed benefit liabilities of participating life policies and liabilities of non-unit investment-linked policies.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.10 Insurance Contracts (continued)

## 2.10.3 Life Insurance Contract Liabilities (continued)

The liability in respect of participating insurance contract is based on the higher of the guaranteed benefit liabilities or the total benefit liabilities at the contract level derived as stated above. Refer to Table 2.10 for details.

In  the  case of life policies where part of, or all the premiums are accumulated in a fund, the accumulated amounts, as declared to policyholders are shown as liabilities if the accumulated amounts are higher than the amounts as calculated using the gross premium valuation method.

In the case of short-term life policies covering contingencies other than death or survival, the liability for such life  insurance contracts comprises the provision for unearned premiums and unexpired risks, together with provision for claims outstanding, including an estimate of the incurred claims that have not yet been reported to the Group.

## Risk transfer

The  Group  issues  a  variety  of  short  and  long  duration  insurance  contracts  which  transfer  risks  from  the policyholders to the Group to protect policyholders from the consequences of insured events such as death, disability, illness, accident, including survival. These contracts may transfer both insurance and investment risk or insurance risk alone, from the policyholders to the Group.

For non-participating policy contracts other than medical insurance policy contracts, the payout to policyholders upon the occurrence of the insured event is pre-determined and the transfer of risk is absolute. For medical insurance policy contracts, the payout is dependent on the actual medical costs incurred upon the occurrence of the insured event.

Contracts  which  transfer  insurance  risk  alone  from  policyholders  to  the  Group  are  commonly  known  as investment linked policies. As part of the pricing for these contracts, the insurance subsidiaries within the Group include certain charges and fees to cover for expenses and insured risk. The net investment returns derived from the variety of investment funds as selected by the policyholders accrue directly to the policyholders.

The Group issues investment linked contracts as an insurance contract which insure human life events such as death or survival over a long duration; coupled with an embedded derivative linking death benefit payments on the contract to the value of a pool of investments within the investment linked fund set up by the insurance subsidiary. As an embedded derivative meets the definition of an insurance contract it need not be separately accounted  for  from  the  host  insurance  contract.  The  liability  valuation  for  such  contracts  is  adjusted  for changes in the fair value of the underlying assets at frequencies in accordance with the terms and conditions of the insurance contracts.

## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Insurance Contracts (continued)

## 2.10.3 Life Insurance Contract Liabilities (continued)

## Subsequent measurement of life insurance contract liabilities

Adjustments to liabilities at each reporting date are recorded in the Profit or Loss Statements. Profits originating from the release in margins for adverse deviations are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statements over the lives of the contracts, whereas losses are fully recognised in the Profit or Loss Statements during the first year.

## Derecognition of life insurance contract liabilities

The liability is extinguished when the contract expires, is discharged or is cancelled.

## Benefits and claims

Insurance contract benefits reflect the cost of all maturities, surrenders, withdrawals and claims arising during the period, as well as policyholder dividends accrued in anticipation of dividend declarations. Accident and health claims incurred include all losses occurring during the period, whether reported or not, related handling costs, a reduction for recoveries, and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.

Claims handling costs include internal and external costs incurred in connection with the negotiation and settlement of claims, and are included in operating expenses.

## Insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF

A  significant  portion  of  insurance  contracts  issued  by  subsidiaries  within  the  Group  contain  discretionary participating features. These contracts are classified as participating policies. In addition to guaranteed benefits payable upon insured events associated with human life such as death or disability, the contracts entitle the policyholder to receive benefits, which could vary according to investment performance of the fund. The Group does not recognise the guaranteed components separately from the discretionary participating features.

Profits to shareholders from the participating fund are allocated from the surplus or surplus capital, determined from the results of the annual actuarial valuation (such valuation also determines the liabilities relating to all the policyholders' benefits of the participating fund) parameters which are set out in the Insurance Regulations of  the  respective  jurisdiction  in  which  the  insurance  subsidiaries  operate.  The  provisions  in  the  Articles  of Association of the insurance subsidiaries within the Group are applied in conjunction with the prescriptions in the respective Insurance regulations, such that the distribution for any year to policyholders of the participating fund  and  shareholders  approximate  90%  and  10%  respectively  of  total  distribution  from  the  participating fund. Any surplus that is not allocated is recognised as unallocated surplus. The unallocated surplus forms part of the life insurance contract liabilities. The annual declaration of the quantum of policyholder bonus and correspondingly the profits to shareholders to be distributed out of the participating fund is approved by the Board of Directors of each insurance subsidiary under the advice of the Appointed Actuary of the respective insurance  subsidiary,  in  accordance  with  the  Insurance  Regulations  and  the  Articles  of  Association  of  the respective insurance subsidiaries.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.10

## Insurance Contracts (continued)

## 2.10.3 Life Insurance Contract Liabilities (continued)

## Liability adequacy test

Each insurance subsidiary within the Group is required by the Insurance Regulations and accounting standards to  carry  out  a  liability  adequacy  test  using  current  estimates  of  future  cash  flows  relating  to  its  insurance contracts; the process is referred to as the gross premium valuation or bonus reserve valuation, depending on the jurisdiction in which the insurance subsidiary operates.

The  liability  adequacy  test  is  applied  to  both  the  guaranteed  benefits  and  the  discretionary  participating features; the assumptions are based on best estimates, the basis adopted is prescribed by the Insurance Regulations of the respective jurisdiction in which the insurance subsidiary operates. The Group performs liability adequacy tests on its actuarial reserves to ensure that the carrying amount of provisions is sufficient to cover estimated future cash flows. When performing the liability adequacy test, the Group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount against the carrying value of the liability. Any deficiency is charged to the Profit or Loss Statement.

## 2.10.4 Non-life Insurance Contract Liabilities

The Group issues short term property and casualty contracts which protect the policyholder against the risk of loss of property premises due to fire or theft in the form of fire or burglary insurance contracts and/or business interruption contracts; risk of liability to pay compensation to a third party for bodily harm or property damage in  the  form  of  public  liability  insurance  contracts.  The  Group  also  issues  short  term  medical  and  personal accident non-life insurance contracts.

Non-life insurance contract liabilities include claim liabilities and premium liabilities.

## Claim liabilities

Claim liabilities are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs and reduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries. Delays can be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of claims, therefore, the ultimate cost of these claims cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date. The liability is calculated at the reporting date using a range of standard actuarial claim projection techniques based on empirical data and current assumptions that may include a margin for adverse deviation. No provision  for  equalisation  or  catastrophe  reserves  is  recognised.  The  liabilities  are  derecognised  when contracts expire, are discharged or are cancelled.

The valuation of non-life insurance claim liabilities at balance sheet date is based on best estimates of the ultimate settlement cost of claims plus a provision for adverse deviation. The provision of adverse deviation is set at 75% level of sufficiency for Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The valuation methods used include the  Paid  and  Incurred  Loss  Development  methods  (also  known  as  the  Link  Ratio  methods),  the  Paid  and Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and the Expected Loss Ratio method. For Singapore and Malaysia, the claim liabilities are not discounted for the time value of money. However, for Indonesia, the claim liabilities are discounted for the time value of money.

## Premium liabilities

Premium liabilities  are  the  provision  of  unearned  premiums  representing  premiums  received  for  risks  that have not yet expired at the reporting date.  The provision is recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged. The provision is released over the terms of the contracts and is recognised as premium income. Further provisions are made if expected future cash flow of unexpired insurance contracts exceed the unearned premiums of these contracts.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.10 Insurance Contracts (continued)

## 2.10.5 Reinsurance Contracts

The Group cedes insurance risk in the normal course of business for all of its businesses. Reinsurance assets represent  amounts  receivable  in  respect  of  ceded  insurance  liabilities.  These  amounts  are  estimated  in  a manner consistent with the reinsured insurance contract liabilities, the outstanding claims provision or settled claims associated with the reinsurer's policies and are in accordance with the related reinsurance contract. Reinsurance assets arising from ceding of in-force book and gross onerous contracts are recognised in the same period when the gross liabilities are accrued.

Reinsurance assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of impairment arises during the financial period. Impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset that the Group may not receive part or all outstanding amounts under the terms of the contract. The impairment loss is recorded in the Profit or Loss Statement. Gains or losses on reinsurance are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement immediately at the date of contract and are not amortised. Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Group from its obligations to policyholders.

The Group also assumes reinsurance risk in the normal course of business for life insurance and non-life insurance contracts where applicable. Premiums and claims on assumed reinsurance are recognised as revenue or expenses in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business. Reinsurance liabilities represent balances due to reinsurance companies. Amounts payable are estimated in a manner consistent with the related reinsurance contract. Premiums and claims are presented on a gross basis for both ceded and assumed reinsurance. Reinsurance assets or liabilities are derecognised when the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or when the contract is transferred to another party.

## 2.11 Recognition of Income and Expense

## 2.11.1 Premiums and Commissions

## Life Insurance Business

First year premiums of insurance policies are recognised from inception date and subsequent renewal premiums are recognised when due. Single premiums are recognised on the dates on which the policies are effective. Premiums from the investment-linked business, universal life and certain Takaful Non-participating products are recognised as revenue when payment is received. Commission is recognised as an expense when incurred.

## Non-Life Insurance Business

Premiums from the non-life insurance business are recognised as revenue upon commencement of insurance cover, in the Profit or Loss Statement. Premiums pertaining to periods outside of the financial reporting period are adjusted through the movement in premium liabilities. Commission is recognised as an expense when incurred, typically upon the risk underwritten as reflected in the premium recognised.

Premiums  ceded  out  and  the  corresponding  commission  income  from  non-life  insurance  contracts  are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement upon receipt of acceptance confirmation from the ceding company or in accordance with provisions incorporated in the treaty contracts. Premiums ceded out pertaining to periods outside of the financial reporting period are adjusted through the movement in unexpired risk reserve.

## 2.11.2 Interest Income

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.11 Recognition of Income and Expense (continued)

## 2.11.3 Dividend Income

Dividend income is recognised as investment income when the Group's right to receive the payment is established. Dividend income from the Company's subsidiaries is recognised when the dividend is declared payable.

## 2.11.4 Rental Income

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate cost of incentives provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

## 2.11.5 Gain/Loss on Sale of Investments

Gains or losses on sale of investments are derived from the difference between net sales proceeds and the purchase or amortised cost. They are recognised on trade date.

## 2.11.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when an annual impairment test for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount.

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement.

A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount  that  would  have  been  determined,  net  of  depreciation,  had  no  impairment  loss  been  recognised previously. Such reversal is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. Unless the asset is measured at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

## 2.11.7 Impairment of Financial Assets

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses ('ECL') on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:

- (i) Debt instruments measured at FVOCI;
- (ii) Loans and receivables measured at amortised cost; and
- (iii) Loan commitments.

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the ECL associated with its loans and debt instruments carried at  amortised  cost  and  FVOCI  and  its  loan  commitments.  For  trade  and  insurance  receivables,  the  Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group recognises a loss allowance for ECL at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.11 Recognition of Income and Expense (continued)

## 2.11.7 Impairment of Financial Assets (continued)

The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for financial instruments on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.

12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Note 33(h) provides more details on how the expected loss allowance is measured.

## Not credit-impaired financial assets

For financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date, the ECL is the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive).

## Modified financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows.

- If the expected modification will not result in derecognition of the existing asset then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If  the  expected modification will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

## Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets measured at amortised cost and debt financial assets measured at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. The Group considers factors such as probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or significant delay in payments.

For financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date, the ECL is the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.

## Write-off

Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.11 Recognition of Income and Expense (continued)

## 2.11.8 Fees and Other Income

Fees and other income comprise mainly management and advisory fee income. Management and advisory fee income includes income earned from the provision of administration services, investment management services, surrenders and other contract fees. This fee income is recognised as revenue over the period in which the services are rendered. If the fees are for services to be provided in future periods, then they are deferred and recognised over those periods.

## 2.11.9 Employee Benefits

## Defined Contribution Plans under Statutory Regulations

The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it has operations. In particular, the Singapore and Malaysia companies in the Group make contributions respectively to  the  Central  Provident  Fund  and  Employees'  Provident  Fund,  which  are  defined  contribution  pension schemes. These contributions are recognised as an expense in the period in which the service is rendered.

## Employee Leave Entitlements

An employee's entitlement to annual leave and long-service leave is estimated and accrued according to the Group's Human Resource policy.

## Share Options

Senior  executives  of  the  Group  are  granted  share  options  in  the  OCBC  Bank's  Share  Option  Scheme  as consideration for services rendered. Options granted are exercisable for up to 10 years. The options may be exercised after the first anniversary of the date of the grant, and generally vest in one-third increments over a 3-year period. The cost of these options is recognised as expense in the Profit or Loss Statement based on the fair value of the options at the date of the grant. The share options are cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The expense is recognised over the vesting period of the grant, with a corresponding increase in liabilities.

The cumulative expense recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

No expense is recognised for options that do not ultimately vest, except for options where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied. In the case where the option does not vest as a result of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition that is within the control of the Group or the senior executives, it is accounted for as a cancellation. In such case, the amount of the compensation cost that otherwise would be recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in the Profit or Loss Statement upon cancellation.

## Deferred Share Plan

In addition to the OCBC Bank's Share Option Scheme, certain employees within the Group are granted OCBC shares under the OCBC Deferred Share Plan ('DSP'). The deferred share awards are granted as part of variable performance bonus. Half of the share awards will vest two years from the grant date and the remaining half will vest at the end of three years from the grant date. The cost of the DSP is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement on the straight-line basis over the vesting period of the DSP .

At each balance sheet date, the cumulative expense is adjusted for the estimated number of shares granted under the DSP that have vested and/or lapsed.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.11 Recognition of Income and Expense (continued)

## 2.11.10 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract involves the use of an identified asset and conveys the right to control the use of the asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration - i.e. the customer has the right to:

- obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from using the asset; and
- direct the use of the asset.

## As Lessee

The  Group  recognises  a  right-of-use  asset  and  a  lease  liability  at  the  commencement  date  of  the  lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the amount of lease liability, any lease payments made or before the commencement date, any indirect costs incurred and an estimate of the costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. The Group generally uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Subsequently, the right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced by any impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effect interest method. It is remeasured to reflect any lease modifications or reassessments.

The Group presents its right-of-use assets in 'property, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'other creditors' in the balance sheet.

## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## As Lessor

The Group classifies all leases for which it is a lessor as operating leases, because each of these leases does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset.

Lease payments from operating leases are recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are included in 'rental income, net'.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.12 Taxes

## 2.12.1 Current Income Tax

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

## 2.12.2 Deferred Tax

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Exceptions include:

- Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
- In  respect  of  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:

- Where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
- In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

## 2

## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.12 Taxes (continued)

## 2.12.2 Deferred Tax (continued)

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and applicable tax laws and jurisdictions) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or  directly  in  equity  and  deferred  tax  arising  from  a  business  combination  is  adjusted  against  goodwill  on acquisition.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, would be recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances changed. The adjustment would either be treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it is incurred during the measurement period or in profit or loss.

## 2.12.3 Sales Tax

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.13 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.

Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

## 2.14 Policy Benefits

Policy benefits are recognised when the policyholder exercises the option to deposit the survival benefits with the life insurance subsidiary companies when the benefit falls due. Policy benefits are interest bearing at rates adjusted from time to time by the life insurance subsidiary companies. Interest payable on policy benefits is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement as incurred.

## 2.15 Claims Admitted or Intimated

Full provision is made for the estimated cost of all life insurance claims notified but not settled at balance sheet date. Provision is made for estimated claims incurred but not reported for all classes of non-life insurance business written.

## 2.16 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition, or are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

## 2.17 Insurance Receivables

Insurance receivables are recognised when due. They are measured at initial recognition at the fair value received or  receivable.  Subsequent to initial  recognition,  insurance  receivables  are  measured  at  amortised  cost,  using  the effective interest method. A loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, with the impairment loss recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. Insurance receivables are derecognised when the derecognition criteria for financial assets, as described in Note 2.18 has been met. The Group's insurance receivables include outstanding premium, policy loan and reinsurance receivables. Policy loans are loans and advances made to policyholders, and are collateralised by the underlying policies.

2020

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.18

## Financial Assets

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial asset. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs for financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are recognised as expense in the Profit or Loss Statement.

## Classification

On  initial  recognition,  a  financial  asset  is  classified  as  measured  at  amortised  cost,  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL').

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as measured at FVTPL:

- The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A debt security is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as measured at FVTPL:

- The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

An equity security that is not held for trading may, by irrevocable election, be designated as measured at FVOCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. The Group has designated certain equity securities held for strategic purposes as measured at FVOCI.

A financial  asset  that  otherwise  meets  the  requirements  to  be  measured  at  amortised  cost  or  at  FVOCI  may,  by irrevocable election, be designated as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The Group has designated certain debt securities which are held with the intent to collect contractual cash flows and sell as measured at FVTPL.

All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

## Business model assessment

The Group assesses the objective of the business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:

- The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice;
- How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed;
- How managers of the business are compensated; and
- The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

Financial assets that are held for trading or whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.18 Financial Assets (continued)

## Business model assessment (continued)

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. If the cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

## Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as profit margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers the following key aspects:

- Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- Leverage features;
- Prepayment and extension terms;
- Terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets; and
- Features that modify consideration of the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

## Subsequent measurement

## 2.18.1 Debt Instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. The three measurement categories for classification of debt instruments are:

## (i) Amortised cost

Debt instruments that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. Gains or losses are also recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised.

## (ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

- Debt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for sale, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are classified as FVOCI. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in fair value reserve. Impairment, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the financial asset is derecognised.
- (iii) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Debt instruments that do not meet the criteria for classification as amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value and interest are recognised in profit or loss.

2020

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.18

## Financial Assets (continued)

## Subsequent measurement (continued)

2.18.2 Equity Instruments

The  Group  subsequently  measures  all  equity  instruments  at  fair  value.  On  initial  recognition  of  an  equity instrument that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. The Group's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than to generate investment returns. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return from such investments are to be recognised in profit or loss when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

Changes in fair value of equity instruments at FVTPL are recognised in profit or loss.

## 2.18.3 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged and the type of hedge relationship designated.

The Group applies hedge accounting for hedges of net investments in foreign operations. At the inception of a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedging relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument's fair  value  in  offsetting  the  exposure  to  changes  in  the  hedged  item's  fair  value  or  cash  flows attributable to the hedged risk.

Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.

For hedges of net investments in foreign operations, gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised as other comprehensive income while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in equity is transferred to the Profit or Loss Statement.

The  Group  uses  forward  currency  contracts  as  hedges  of  its  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  on  its investments in foreign subsidiaries.

## Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets.

## Derecognition

A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired or has been transferred such that substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.18 Financial Assets (continued)

On derecognition of a financial asset, except for equity securities measured at FVOCI, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI, is recognised in Profit or Loss Statement.

On derecognition of equity securities measured at FVOCI, any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI is not recognised in Profit or Loss Statement, but retained in OCI.

## Regular way purchase or sale of a financial asset

All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised or derecognised on trade date i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned.

## 2.19 Financial Liabilities

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when the Group becomes a party to the contractual obligations of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, plus, in the case of financial liabilities other than derivatives, directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group's financial  liabilities  include  other  creditors,  provision  for  agents'  retirement  benefits,  debt  issued  and derivative liabilities.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:

## 2.19.1 Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  include  financial  liabilities  held  for  trading.  Financial liabilities  are  classified  as  held  for  trading  if  they  are  acquired  for  the  purpose  of  selling  in  the  near  term and include derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships.

Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial liabilities are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement.

## 2.19.2 Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost

After  initial  recognition,  other  financial  liabilities  that  are  not  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.

## Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.20 Offsetting of Financial Instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet, when and only when, there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The financial assets and financial liabilities that are offset are immaterial.

## 2.21 Determination of Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted or published bid prices on the balance sheet date. If quoted prices are not available over the counter, broker or dealer price quotations are used.

For units in unit trusts and shares in open-ended investment companies, fair value is determined by reference to published bid-values.

For financial instruments where there is no active market, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques. Such techniques include using recent arm's length transactions, reference to the current market value of another instrument  which  is  substantially  the  same,  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  and/or  option  pricing  models.  For discounted cash flow techniques, estimated future cash flows are based on management's best estimates based on  market's  perspective  and  the  discount  rate  is  a  market-related  rate  for  a  similar  instrument.  Certain  financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual, and market prices, correlation, time value of money, credit risk, yield curve volatility factors and/ or prepayment rates of the underlying positions. The use of different pricing models and assumptions could produce materially different estimates of fair values.

The fair value of floating rate and overnight deposits with financial institutions is their carrying value. The carrying value is the cost of the deposit and accrued interest. The fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates for similar instruments at the balance sheet date.

## 2.22 Intangible Assets

## 2.22.1   Goodwill

Goodwill  is  initially  measured  at  cost.  Following  initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less  any accumulated impairment losses.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

The cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by  assessing  the  recoverable  amount  of  each  cash-generating  unit  (or  group  of  cash-generating  units)  to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.22 Intangible Assets

## 2.22.1   Goodwill (continued)

Goodwill and fair value adjustments which arose on acquisitions of foreign subsidiaries before 1 January 2005 are deemed to be assets and liabilities of the parent company and are recorded in SGD at the rates prevailing at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and are recorded in the functional currency of the foreign operations and translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date.

## 2.22.2   Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  amortisation  and  any  accumulated  impairment losses.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Profit or Loss Statement.

## 2.23 Property, Plant and Equipment

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated. No depreciation is provided for 999-year leasehold land. No depreciation is provided on capital works in progress as the assets are not yet available for use.

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of an asset. The useful lives are as follows:

| Buildings                                         | 50 years      |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Office furniture, fittings and equipment          | 5 to 10 years |
| Renovation                                        | 3 to 5 years  |
| Computer equipment and software development costs | 3 to 10 years |
| Motor vehicles                                    | 5 years       |

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.23 Property, Plant and Equipment (continued)

The  carrying  values  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  reviewed  for  impairment  when  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.

The  residual  values,  useful  life  and  depreciation  method  are  reviewed  at  each  financial  year-end  and  adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. This is to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the Profit or Loss Statement in the year the asset is derecognised.

## 2.24 Investment Properties

Investment properties are properties that are owned by the Group in order to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, or in the ordinary course of business. Investment properties comprise completed investment properties and properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties.

Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. The carrying amount includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value which reflects market conditions at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement in the year in which they arise.

Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement in the year of retirement or disposal.

Transfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a change in use. For a transfer from investment property to owner occupied property, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of change in use. For a transfer from owner occupied property to investment property, the property is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment set out in Note 2.23 up to the date of change in use.

## 2.25 Provision for Agents' Retirement Benefits

Provision  for  agents'  retirement  benefits  is  set  aside  for  agents  of  the  Malaysian  operations  and  is  calculated  in accordance with the terms and conditions in the respective agent's agreement ('the Agreement'). The terms and conditions of the Agreement stipulate that upon the agent maintaining his position for the qualifying year and achieving the required personal sales and minimum new business, the agent shall be allocated a deferred benefit/retirement benefit. The deferred benefit/retirement benefit accumulated at Balance Sheet date includes accrued interest. The accrued deferred benefit shall only become payable provided the Agreement has been in force for certain continuous contract years and the agent has attained the minimum retirement age stipulated in the Agreement. The carrying amount is based on amortised cost.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## 2.26 Related Parties

A related party is defined as follows:

- (a) A person or a close member of that person's family is related to the Group and Company if that person:
- (i) Has control or joint control over the Company;
- (ii) Has significant influence over the Company; or
- (iii) Is a member of the key management personnel of the Group or Company or of a parent of the Company.
- (b) An entity is related to the Group and the Company if any of the following conditions applies:
- (i) The entity and the Company are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others);
- (ii) One entity is  an  associate  or  joint  venture  of  the  other  entity  (or  an  associate  or  joint  venture  of  a member of a group of which the other entity is a member);
- (iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party;
- (iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity;
- (v) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of the employees of either the Company or an entity related to the Company. If the Company is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the Company;
- (vi) The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a);
- (vii) A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity);
- (viii) The entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity.

In the Company's financial statements, loans to subsidiaries are interest-free and stated at fair value at inception. The difference between the fair value and the loan amount at inception is recognised as additional investment in subsidiaries in the Company's financial statements. Subsequently, these loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The unwinding of the difference is recognised as interest income in the Profit or Loss Statement over the expected repayment period.

## 2.27 Segment Reporting

For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on their products and services. The management regularly reviews the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess the segment performance. Additional disclosures on each of these segments are shown in Note 32, including the factors used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement basis of segment information.

## 2.28 Share Capital and Share Issuance Expenses

Proceeds  from  issuance  of  ordinary  shares  are  recognised  as  share  capital  in  equity.  Incremental  costs  directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares are deducted against share capital.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.29 Contingencies

A contingent liability is:

- (a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or
- (b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
- (i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or
- (ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and for which the fair values can be reliably determined.

## 2.30 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

In the preparation of the Group's financial statements, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are continually evaluated and based on internal studies of actual historical experience and other factors. Best estimates and assumptions are constantly reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant and valid. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.

## (a) Liabilities of insurance business

The estimation of the ultimate liability arising from claims made under life and non-life insurance contracts is  the  Group's  most critical  accounting estimate. There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be considered in the estimation of the liabilities that the Group will ultimately be required to pay as claims.

For life  insurance contracts, estimates are made for future deaths, morbidity, disabilities, lapses, voluntary terminations, investment returns, administration expenses and discount rates (note 2.10). The Group relies on standard industry and national mortality and morbidity tables which represent historical experience, and makes appropriate adjustments for its respective risk exposures and portfolio experience in deriving the mortality and morbidity estimates. These estimates provide the basis for the valuation of the future benefits to be paid to policyholders and to ensure adequate provisions which are monitored against current and future premiums. For those contracts that insure risk on longevity and disability, estimates are made based on recent past experience and emerging trends. Epidemics and changing patterns of lifestyle could result in significant changes to the expected future exposures. Each year, these estimates are assessed for adequacy and changes will be reflected as adjustments to insurance contract liabilities. The carrying value of life insurance contract liabilities, gross as at 31 December 2020 amounted to $82,906.1 million (31 December 2019: $74,159.8 million).

For non-life insurance contracts, estimates have to be made for both the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the balance sheet date and for the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred but not yet reported at the balance sheet date ('IBNR').

It can take a significant time before the ultimate claims costs can be established with certainty and for some type of policies, IBNR claims form the majority of the balance sheet liability. The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques such as Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.30 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments (continued)

## (a) Liabilities of insurance business (continued)

The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a company's past development experience can be  used  to  project  future  claims  development  and  hence,  ultimate  claim  costs.  As  such,  these  methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident years but can also be further analysed by significant business lines and claims type. Large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face of loss adjustor estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development. In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in future, (for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors, economic conditions as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy features and claims handling procedures) in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that present the likely outcome from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all uncertainties involved. The carrying value of non-life insurance contract liabilities - claims liabilities, gross as at 31 December 2020 amounted to $351.0 million (31 December 2019: $280.2 million).

## (b) Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the deductibility of certain expenses and taxability of certain income during the estimation of the provision for income taxes. Certain subsidiaries within the Group have significant open tax positions, which represent the positions that have not been finalised with the tax authorities. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different  from  the  amounts  that  were  initially  recorded,  such  differences  will  impact  the  income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination is made. The carrying amount of the income tax and deferred tax provisions as at 31 December 2020 amounted to $1,710.1 million (31 December 2019: $2,101.0 million).

## (c) Impairment of goodwill

The Group conducts impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2.22. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on the value-in-use method, which adopts a discounted cash flow approach on projections, budgets and forecasts over a 5-year period. Cash flows beyond the fifth year are extrapolated using estimated terminal growth rates not exceeding the long-term average growth of the industry and country in which the cash-generating unit operates.  The  discount  rates  applied  to  the  cash  flow  projections  are  derived  from  the  Group's  weighted average cost of capital at the date of assessment. Changes to the assumptions, particularly the discount rate and terminal growth rate, may significantly affect the results of the impairment test. Further details of the key assumptions applied in the impairment assessment of goodwill are provided in Note 26.

## (d) Impairment of financial assets

The impairment provisions for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Group's past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. For details of the key assumptions and inputs used, see Note 33(h).

## 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 2.30 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments (continued)

## (e) Insurance contract classification

Contracts  are  classified  as  insurance  contracts  where  they  transfer  significant  insurance  risk  from  the policyholder to the Group. The Group exercises judgment about the level of insurance risk transferred. The level of insurance risk is assessed by considering whether upon the insured event the Group is required to pay significant additional benefits. These additional benefits include claims liability and assessment costs, but exclude the loss of the ability to charge the policyholder for future services. The assessment covers the whole of the expected term of the contract where such additional benefits could be payable. Some contracts contain options for the policyholder to purchase insurance risk protection at a later date; these insurance risks are deemed not significant.

## (f) Property classification

Investment property is a property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both.

Some properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and another portion that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.

If  these  portions  could  be  sold  separately  (or  leased  separately  under  a  finance  lease),  the  Group  would account for these portions separately. If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is an investment property only if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Judgment is made on an individual property basis to determine whether ancillary services are so significant that a property does not qualify as investment property.

## Unrecognised tax losses

At the balance sheet date, the Group has tax losses of approximately $30.1 million (31 December 2019: $28.3 million) expiring in 2021 - 2024 (31 December 2019: 2020-2023)  that are available for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose, for which no deferred tax asset is recognised due to uncertainty of its recoverability.

## 11 RESERVES

Merger reserve represents the difference between the fair value and nominal value of shares issued for the acquisition of a subsidiary. The merger reserve had been utilised in part in prior years to write-off the goodwill on acquisition of the subsidiary.

The currency translation reserve represents exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currencies are different from that of the Group's presentation currency. The currency translation reserve is also used to record the effect of hedging of net investment in foreign operations.

The fair value reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of financial assets measured at FVOCI and the related loss allowance recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement until the assets are derecognised, net of tax.

The other reserve represents the gain or loss on disposal of interest in subsidiary, without loss of control, reclassifed to equity.

The table above shows the fair value of derivative financial instruments, recorded as assets or liabilities together with their notional amounts.  The notional amount, recorded gross, is the amount of a derivative's underlying asset, reference rate or index and the basis upon which changes in the value of derivatives are measured.

The fair value of derivatives shown above represents the current risk exposure but not the maximum risk exposure that would arise in the future as a result of the changes in value.

The Group's maximum exposure to loss on the interests presented above is the carrying amount of the Group's investments.

The Group has not provided any financial or other support to the unconsolidated structured entities as at the reporting date, and there are no intentions to provide support in the foreseeable future.

## 25 INTERESTS IN STRUCTURED ENTITIES (CONTINUED) 25.2 Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities

The Group receives management fees in respect of its asset management business. The Group does not sponsor any of the funds or investment vehicles from which it receives fees. Management fees received for investments that the Group manages but does not have a holding in also represent an interest in unconsolidated structured entities. As these investments are not held by the Group, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore the Group's maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees. The table below shows the assets under management of entities that the Group manages but does not have a holding in and the fees earned from those entities.

| Subsidiary - PT Great Eastern General Insurance Indonesia     |               |
| Carrying value of capitalised goodwill as at 31 December 2020 | $2.3 million  |
| Basis on which recoverable values are determined (1)          | Value in use  |
| Terminal growth rate (2)                                      | 11%           |

(1) The value-in-use calculation applies a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on financial budget and forecast approved by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the fifth year are extrapolated using the terminal growth rate stated above.

(2) The terminal growth rates used do not exceed the long term average past growth rates of the industries and countries in which Lion Global Investors Limited, Great Eastern General Insurance (Malaysia) Berhad and PT Great Eastern General Insurance Indonesia operate.

(3) The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is pre-tax and is derived from the cost of capital plus a reasonable risk premium. This is the benchmark used by management to assess the operating performance.

No impairment loss (2019: nil) was recognised for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 against the amounts of goodwill recorded above to write down the carrying value to recoverable value. A reasonably possible change in key assumptions will not cause the carrying values above to materially exceed the recoverable amounts.

## 29 EXECUTIVES' SHARE OPTION SCHEME

## 29.1 OCBC Share Option Scheme

In April 2005, the GEH Optionholders were nominated to participate in the OCBC Bank Share Option Scheme (2001) ('OCBC Option Scheme'). The acquisition price of the options granted is equal to the average of the last dealt price of the ordinary shares of OCBC Bank over five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date of the grant. The options vest in one-third increments over a period of three years, and are exercisable after the first anniversary of the date of grant up to the date of expiration of the options. The share options have a validity period of 10 years from date of grant.

The fair value of the share options is recognised by the GEH Group as staff costs in the Profit or Loss Statement.   The Group uses the binomial model to derive the fair value of share options granted by OCBC Bank.  The value of the share options is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement over the vesting period of the share options.  At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable, and the impact of the change to the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement.

## 29 EXECUTIVES' SHARE OPTION SCHEME (CONTINUED)

## 29.1 OCBC Share Option Scheme (continued)

At the Extraordinary General Meeting of OCBC Bank held on 19 April 2007, certain alterations proposed by OCBC Bank's Remuneration Committee to OCBC Option Scheme were approved by its shareholders. These alterations enable option holders to select one of the following alternatives when exercising their options:

- (i) All share election - an election to receive in full the number of ordinary shares upon full payment of the aggregate acquisition cost in respect of options exercised;
- (ii) Partial share election - an election to receive ordinary shares representing the notional profit which would have been derived if the ordinary shares in respect of the options exercised had been sold; or
- (iii) Cash election - an election to receive in cash the profit derived from the sale of OCBC Bank's share in respect of the options exercised.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2020, there were no options granted under the OCBC Share Option Scheme (2019: nil) to GEH Optionholders to acquire ordinary shares in OCBC Bank ('OCBC shares') pursuant to 2001 scheme, and no options were granted to a director of the Company (2019: nil).

Information with respect to the number of options granted under the OCBC Option Scheme to GEH Optionholders is as follows:

## 29 EXECUTIVES' SHARE OPTION SCHEME (CONTINUED) 29.2 OCBC Deferred Share Plan ('DSP')

The DSP is a share-based plan implemented in 2003 and administered by the OCBC Remuneration Committee. The DSP is a discretionary share-based incentive and retention award program extended to executives of OCBC's subsidiaries at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The awards are granted at no cost to the grantees, on a deferred basis as part of their performance bonus. Such awards shall lapse by reason of cessation of service but may be preserved at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The DSP does not involve the issue of new shares. Instead, existing shares will be purchased from the market for release to the grantees at the end of the respective vesting periods.

During the financial year, 631,571 (2019: 313,495) OCBC ordinary shares were granted to eligible executives of GEH Group under the DSP , of which none (2019: nil) were granted to a director of the Company. The fair value of the shares at grant date was $6.0 million (2019: $3.5 million). In addition, 46,388 OCBC shares (of which none were granted to directors of the Company) were awarded to grantees pursuant to declarations of final dividend for financial year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: 28,753 OCBC shares (of which none were granted to directors of the Company) awarded to grantees pursuant to declarations of final dividend for financial year ended 31 December 2018).

## 29.3 OCBC Employee Share Purchase Plan ('ESP')

All employees of OCBC Bank and their subsidiaries who have attained the age of 21 years and have been employees for a period of not less than six months are eligible to participate in the ESP Plan unless they are also controlling shareholders of the Bank or their associates. The purpose of the ESP Plan is to provide employees with an opportunity to increase their personal equity interest in the Bank. The Bank will either issue new shares or transfer treasury shares to employees upon the exercise or conversion of acquisition rights. The ESP Plan is administered by the OCBC Bank Remuneration Committee.

The acquisition price is equal to the average of the last traded price of the ordinary shares of OCBC Bank on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited over the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the price fixing date for the acquisition price of the ordinary shares (as determined by the OCBC Bank Remuneration Committee).

A participant may participate in the ESP Plan for an offering period by making contributions in cash by means of monthly deductions from his monthly base salary and/or his designated account; and/or by monthly debits from his CPF Ordinary Account to his ESP Plan account.

In June 2020, the fifteenth offering of the ESP Plan was launched for employees to acquire the shares of OCBC Bank at $8.98 per share. The plan commenced on 1 July 2020 and will expire on 30 June 2022. Under the offering, OCBC Bank granted 1,466,659 (2019: 980,689) rights to acquire ordinary shares in the Bank. The fair value of the rights, determined using the binomial valuation model was $1.6 million (2019: $0.8 million). Significant inputs to the valuation model are set out below.

## 32 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION

## Business Segments

For management purposes, the Group's operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products for the different markets. The Group's principal operations are organised into the Life Insurance, Non-life Insurance and Shareholders segments. The results of these segments are reported separately in internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance.

## a. Life Insurance Segment

The Life Insurance segment provides different types of products, comprising life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, annuity business written and includes the unit-linked business. All revenues in the Life Insurance segment are from external customers.

## b. Non-life Insurance Segment

Under the Non-life Insurance business, the Group issues short term property and casualty contracts which protect the policyholder against the risk of loss of property premises due to fire or theft in the form of fire or burglary insurance contract and/or business interruption contract; risk of liability to pay compensation to a third party for bodily harm or property damage in the form of public liability insurance contract. The Group also issues short term medical and personal accident non-life insurance contracts.

## c. Shareholders Segment

The Shareholders segment provides fund management services for absolute return/balanced mandates with different risk-return characteristics and manages a range of products, including Asia Pacific equities, Asian and global fixed income securities portfolios.

Segment results,  assets  and  liabilities  include  items  directly  attributable  to  a  segment  as  well  as  those  that  can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets, income tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities, interest-bearing loans and related expenses. Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to an unrelated third parties. Segment revenue, expenses and results include transfers between business segments. These transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

## Governance framework (continued)

Group ALC is responsible for balance sheet management. Specifically, Group ALC reviews and formulates technical frameworks,  policies,  processes  and  methodologies  relating  to  balance  sheet  management.  Group  ALC  is  also responsible for ensuring compliance and alignment with Group Governance and Oversight Framework, i.e. Group standards and guidelines. Group ALC is supported by the Local ALC.

Group TSC is responsible for assisting GMC in providing the overall strategic direction and approval of all IT related issues and initiatives, including the digitalisation and transformation programs to support the Group's strategic growth into the future. Group TSC is supported by local TSC.

Group PMAC is responsible for reviewing, approving and managing new and existing products, ensuring the business operates within the risk appetite to deliver the annual business targets. Local PDC is responsible for reviewing and endorsing new products at the local operating subsidiaries.

## Regulatory framework

Insurers  are  required  to  comply  with  the  Insurance  Act  and  Regulations,  as  applicable,  including  guidelines  on investment limits. The responsibility for the formulation, establishment and approval of the investment policy rests with the respective Board of Directors ('Board'). The Board exercises oversight on investments to safeguard the interests of policyholders and shareholders.

## Capital management

The objectives of GEH's capital management policy are to create shareholder value, deliver sustainable returns to shareholders, maintain a strong capital position with sufficient buffer to meet policyholders' obligations and regulatory requirements and make strategic investments for business growth.

The Group had no significant changes in the policies and processes relating to its capital structure during the year.

## Regulatory Capital

The Group and its insurance subsidiaries are required to comply with the capital ratios prescribed by the Insurance Regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Capital Adequacy Ratios of the Group and its subsidiaries in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia remained well above the regulatory minimum ratios under the Risk-based Capital Frameworks established by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Bank Negara Malaysia and Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, Indonesia respectively.

The  Group's  approach  to  capital  management  aims  to  maintain  an  adequate  level  of  capital  to  meet  regulatory requirements, including any additional amounts required by the regulators of the Group and its insurance subsidiaries. This involves managing assets, liabilities and risks in a coordinated way by assessing and monitoring available and required capital (by each regulated entity) on a regular basis and, where appropriate, taking appropriate actions to adjust the capital position of the Group and/or its subsidiaries in light of changes in economic conditions and risk characteristics.

The  primary  sources  of  capital  of  the  Group  are  shareholders'  equity  and  issued  subordinated  debt.  The  Group defines available capital as the amount of assets in excess of liabilities measured in accordance with the Insurance Regulations of the respective jurisdictions in which the insurance subsidiaries operate.

## Dividend

GEH's dividend policy aims to provide shareholders with a predictable and sustainable dividend return, payable on a half-yearly basis.

The following sections provide details of the Group's and Company's exposure to insurance and key financial risks, as well as the objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks.

There has been no change to the Group's exposure to these insurance and key financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks.

## Insurance Risk

The principal activity of the Group is the provision of insurance products and related financial advisory services. The products cover risks such as mortality, morbidity (health, disability, critical illness, personal accident) and property and casualty, and meet customer needs in investment and retirement provision.

The Group's underwriting strategy is designed to ensure that risks are well diversified across the types of risk and level of insured benefits. This is largely achieved through diversification across industry sectors and geography, the use of medical screening in order to ensure that pricing takes into account of current health conditions and family medical history,  regular  review  of  actual  claims  experience,  as  well  as  detailed  claims  handling  procedures.  Underwriting limits are also established to enforce appropriate risk selection criteria. For example, the Group has the right to reject renewal of insurance policy, impose deductibles and reject payment of fraudulent claims.

Risks inherent in the Group's activities include but are not limited to the following:

## Insurance Risks of Life Insurance Contracts

Insurance risks arise when the Group underwrites insurance contracts. While insurance risks may not vary significantly across the geographical locations in which the Group currently operates, the types of risks insured, assumptions used in pricing the insurance products and subsequent setting aside of the technical provisions may give rise to potential shortfalls  in  provision  for  future  claims  and  expenses  when  actual  claims  experience  are  worse  than  projections. Assumptions that may cause insurance risks to be underestimated include assumptions on policy lapses, mortality, morbidity and expenses.

## 33 ENTERPRISE RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## Insurance risk (continued)

## Insurance Risks of Life Insurance Contracts (continued)

The Group utilises reinsurance to manage the mortality and morbidity risks. The Group's reinsurance management strategy and policy are reviewed annually by RMC and Group ALC. Reinsurance is structured according to the type of  risk  insured.  Catastrophe  reinsurance  is  procured  to  limit  catastrophic  losses.  The  Group's  exposure  to  group insurance business is not significant and there is no material concentration risk.

In general, reinsurers must have a minimum credit rating of S&amp;P A- or equivalent to be considered for reinsurance business. The Group limits its risk to any one reinsurer by ceding different products to different reinsurers or to a panel of reinsurers.

Group ALC reviews the actual experience of mortality, morbidity, lapses and surrenders, and expenses and ensures that the policies, guidelines and limits established for managing the risks remain adequate and appropriate.

A substantial portion of the Group's life insurance funds is participating in nature. In the event of volatile investment climate and/or unusual claims experience, the insurer has the option of revising the bonus payable to policyholders.

For  non-participating  funds,  the  risk  is  that  the  guaranteed  policy  benefits  must  be  met  even  when  investment portfolios perform below expectations, or claims experience is higher than expected.

For investment-linked funds, the risk exposure for the Group is limited only to the underwriting aspect as all investment risks are borne by the policyholders.

Stress Testing is  performed at least once a year to assess the solvency of the life insurance fund under various stress scenarios. The stress scenarios include regulatory prescribed scenarios, as well as scenarios depicting drastic changes in key parameters such as new business volume, market volatilities, expense patterns, mortality/morbidity patterns and lapse rates.

## Insurance Risk of Non-Life Insurance Contracts

Risks under non-life insurance policies usually cover a twelve-month duration. The risk inherent in non-life insurance contracts  is  reflected  in  the  insurance  contract  liabilities  which  include  the  premium  and  claims  liabilities,  as  set out under Note 15 of the financial statements. The premium liabilities comprise a reserve for unexpired risks, while the  claims  liabilities  comprise  the  loss  reserves  which  include  both  provision  for  outstanding  claims  notified  and outstanding claims incurred but not reported.

## Key Assumptions

Non-life  insurance  contract  liabilities  are  determined  based  on  claims  experience,  knowledge  of  existing  events, the terms and conditions of the relevant policies and interpretation of circumstances. Of particular relevance is past experience with similar cases, trends in historical claims, legislative changes, judicial decisions, economic conditions and claims handling procedures. The estimates of the non-life insurance contract liabilities are therefore sensitive to various factors and uncertainties. The actual future premium and claims liabilities will not develop exactly as projected and may vary from initial estimates.

Insurance risk of non-life insurance contracts is mitigated by achieving a large and well-diversified portfolio of insurance contracts across various industries and geographical areas. The risks are further mitigated by careful selection and implementation of underwriting strategies, which are designed to ensure that risks are diversified in terms of type of risk and level of insured benefits. Comprehensive assessment of new and on-going claims, regular detailed review of claims handling procedures and frequent investigation of possible fraudulent claims are established to further reduce the risk exposure of the Group. In addition, the Group further enforces a policy of active management and prompt pursuit of claims, in order to reduce its exposure to unpredictable future developments that can negatively impact the Group.

The Group has also limited its exposure by imposing maximum claim amounts on certain contracts as well as the use of reinsurance arrangements in order to limit exposure to catastrophic events such as hurricanes, earthquakes and flood damages.

The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of changes in key assumptions on gross and net liabilities, profit before tax and equity.

## 33 ENTERPRISE RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## Market and Credit Risk

Market risk arises when market values of assets and liabilities are adversely affected by  changes in financial markets. Changes in interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates,  equity  prices  and  prices  of  alternative  investment  assets  can impact present and future earnings of the insurance operations, as well as shareholders' equity.

The Group is exposed to market risk through its investment portfolios, as well as in the mismatches between assets and liabilities of the Insurance Funds. In the case of the third-party funds managed by Lion Global Investors, investment risks are borne by investors and the Group does not assume any liability in the event of occurrence of loss or writedown in market valuations.

Group  ALC,  Group  IC  and  Local  ALCs  actively  manage  market  risks  through  the  setting  of  investment  policies and asset allocations, approving portfolio construction, risk measurement methodologies, as well as hedging and alternative  risk  transfer  strategies.  Investment  limits  are  monitored  at  various  levels  to  ensure  that  all  investment activities are conducted within the Group's risk appetite and in line with the Group's management principles and philosophies. Compliance with established limits forms an integral part of the risk governance and financial reporting framework. The approach adopted by the Group in managing the various types of risk, including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity price risk, credit risk, alternative investment risk and liquidity risk, is briefly described below:

- (a) Interest rate risk (including asset liability mismatch). The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through (i)  investments  in  fixed  income  instruments  and  (ii)  policy  liabilities  in  the  Insurance  Funds.  Since  the Shareholders' Fund has exposure to investments in fixed income instruments but no exposure to insurance policy liabilities, it will incur economic losses when interest rates rise. Given the long duration of policy liabilities and the uncertainties in the cash flows of Insurance Funds, it is not possible to hold assets with duration that perfectly matches the duration of the policy liabilities. This results in interest rate risk and asset liability mismatch risk, and these risks are managed and monitored by Group ALC and Local ALCs. The Insurance Funds will incur an economic loss when interest rates drop as the duration of policy liabilities is generally longer than the duration of fixed income assets.

Under Singapore regulations governed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the discounting rate used for discounting liability cash flows may include a positive adjustment in the form of Matching Adjustment, or Illiquidity Premium, subject to certain conditions being met. As a result, the Singapore non-participating funds could have losses when the magnitude of the adjustment decreases.

Under Malaysia regulations governed by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), liability cash flows with durations less than 15 years are discounted using zero-coupon spot yields of Malaysia Government Securities (MGS) with matching durations, while liability cash flows with durations of 15 years or more are discounted using zerocoupon spot yield of MGS with a 15-year term to maturity. As a result, the Malaysia non-participating fund could have losses when the zero-coupon spot yields of MGS decrease.

## Market and Credit Risk (continued)

- (b) Foreign  exchange  risk. The  foreign  exchange  risk  inherent  in  foreign  currency  fixed  income  portfolio  is typically hedged using currency forwards and swaps wherever practical and cost-effective. Foreign exchange instruments are also used for efficient portfolio management.

The SGD and RM positions predominately arose from the entities within the Group with the same respective functional currencies. The Group has no significant concentration of foreign exchange risk.

Limits are set on the total amount of foreign currency (net of liabilities) to cap the Group's foreign exchange risk.

The financial assets and financial liabilities of the Company are not material.

## 33 ENTERPRISE RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## Market and Credit Risk (continued)

- (c) Equity price risk. Exposure to equity price risk exists in both assets and liabilities.  Asset exposure exists through direct equity, equity derivatives and fund investments, where the Group, through investments, bears all or most of the equity volatility and investment risks. Equity price risk also exists in investment-linked products where the revenues of the insurance operations are linked to the performances of underlying equity funds since this has an impact on the level of fees earned. Limits are set for single security holdings as a percentage of total equity holdings.
- (d) Credit spread risk. Exposure to credit spread risk exists in the Group's bond investments. Credit spread is the difference between the quoted yields of a credit and a government bond of the same maturity. Credit spreads widen when the default risk of credit bonds increases. Hence, widening credit spreads will result mark-tomarket losses in the Group's bond portfolio.
- (e) Alternative investment risk. The Group is exposed to alternative investment risk through investments in real estate that it owns in Singapore and Malaysia, and through real estate funds, private equities, infrastructure and hedge funds with exposures in other countries. A monitoring process is established to manage foreign exchange,  country  and  manager  concentration  risks.  This  process  and  the  acquisition  or  divestment  of alternative investments are reviewed and approved by RMC and Group IC.
- (f) Commodity risk. The Group does not have any direct exposure to commodity risk.
- (g) Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises when the Group is unable to meet its cash flow demands, or if the assets backing the liabilities cannot be sold quickly enough without incurring significant losses. For an insurance company, the greatest liquidity needs typically arise from its insurance liabilities. Demands for funds can usually be met through ongoing normal operations via premiums received, sale of assets or borrowings. Unexpected demands for liquidity may be triggered by negative publicity, deterioration of the economy, adverse news on other companies in the same or similar lines of business, unanticipated policy claims, or other unexpected cash demands from policyholders.

Expected liquidity demands are managed through a combination of treasury, investment and asset-liability management practices, which are monitored on an ongoing basis. Actual and projected cash inflows and outflows are regularly monitored, and a reasonable amount of liquid assets are maintained at all times. The projected  cash  flows  from  the  in-force  insurance  policy  contract  liabilities  consist  of  renewal  premiums, commissions, claims, maturities and surrenders.  Renewal premiums, commissions, claims and maturities are generally stable and predictable. Surrenders can be more uncertain although these have been quite stable over the past several years.

Unexpected liquidity demands are mitigated through a combination of product design, risk diversification, investment strategies and systematic monitoring. Surrender penalty in insurance contracts also protects the Group from losses due to unexpected surrender trends and reduces the sensitivity of surrenders to changes in interest rates.

## Market and Credit Risk (continued)

- (h) Credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor failing to discharge an obligation. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk through (i) investments in cash and bonds, (ii) corporate lending activities and (iii) exposure to counterparty's credit in derivative transactions and reinsurance contracts. For all three types of exposures, financial loss may materialise as a result of a downgrading of credit rating or credit default by the borrower or counterparty.

The  task  of  evaluating  and  monitoring  credit  risk  is  undertaken  by  Local  ALCs.  Group-wide  credit  risk  is managed by Group ALC. The Group establishes internal limits by issuer, counterparty and investment grade which are actively monitored to manage the credit and concentration risk and reviewed on a regular basis. The creditworthiness of reinsurers is assessed on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength through published credit ratings and other publicly available financial information.

Reinsurance is placed with counterparties that have a good credit rating and concentration of risk is mitigated through counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved on an annual basis.

Credit risk arising from customer balances incurred on non-payment of premiums or contributions will only persist during the grace period specified in the policy document or trust deed until expiry, when the policy is either paid up or terminated.

The Group issues unit-linked investment policies in which the policyholder bears the investment risk on the assets held in the unit-linked funds as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value of the assets in the fund. Therefore, the Group has no material credit risk or market risk on unit-linked financial assets.

The loans in the Group's portfolio are generally secured by collateral, with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 70%. The amount and type of collateral required depend on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. Guidelines on the collateral eligibility of collateral have been established, and all collaterals are revalued on a regular basis.  Management monitors the market values of collaterals, requests additional collaterals when needed and performs an impairment valuation when applicable.  The fair values of collaterals, held by the Group as lender, for which it is entitled to sell or pledge in the event of default is as tabulated below:

## Amounts arising from ECL

ECL is recognised for credit-impaired and non-credit impaired exposure in accordance to SFRS (I) 9 through a forward-looking ECL models.

## Measurement of ECL - Explanation of inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques

The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the following variables:

- probability of default ('PD');
- loss given default ('LGD'); and
- exposure at default ('EAD').

These parameters are derived from statistical models internally developed by the Group.

PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months ('12M PD'), or over the remaining lifetime ('Lifetime PD') of the obligation. PD estimates are derived from PD models that incorporate both quantitative and qualitative inputs, which are in turn derived from internal and external compiled data.

LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss incurred during a default. LGD is expressed as a percentage of loss per unit of exposure at the time of default and represents an estimate of the economic loss in the event of the default of the counterparty. Factors in determining LGDs include claim seniority, availability and quality of collateral, legal enforceability processes in the jurisdiction and industry of borrower and prevailing market conditions. They are estimates at a certain date and are derived using statistical models. These statistical models are developed using internally compiled data and incorporate both quantitative and qualitative factors. The model outputs are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information whenever appropriate.

EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD based on the current exposure to the counterparty and potential future exposure.

The  ECL  is  determined  by  projecting  PD,  LGD  and  EAD  for  each  individual  exposure.  The  ECLs  are  first determined  from  the  product  of  these  three  components,  which  are  then  adjusted  for  forward-looking information. The ECLs are finally discounted to the reporting date. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation is the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof.

## Significant increase in credit risk

To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information, which includes the following indicators:

-  Internal credit rating
-  External credit rating
-  Actual  or  expected  significant  adverse  changes  in  business,  financial  or  economic  conditions  that  are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty's ability to meet its obligations.

A  movement  of  an  obligor's  credit  rating  along  the  rating  scale  represents  a  change  in  the  credit  risk  as measured by the change in PD.

The criteria for assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly will be determined by both quantitative changes  in  12M  PDs  and  qualitative  factors.  The  credit  risk  of  an  obligor  is  deemed  to  have  increased significantly since initial recognition if, based on the Group's quantitative model, the 12M PD is determined to have more than doubled since origination, except when the obligor remains within the investment grade ratings.

Using its expert credit judgment and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Group may determine that an obligor has undergone a significant increase in credit risk based on qualitative indicators that it considers are indicative of such and whose effect may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. The Group uses the watch-list as an additional trigger for the identification of significant increase in credit risk.

The Group considers an obligor to have 'low credit risk' if it is of investment grade, taking into account both internal and external credit ratings.

## (h) Credit risk. (continued)

## Credit risk grades

The Group assigns each obligor to a credit risk grade that reflects the PD of the obligor. Credit risk grades are established based on qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of default risk. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of counterparty.

Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the default risk increases as credit risk deteriorates. Each exposure is assigned with a credit risk grade at initial recognition, based on available information on the borrower. Obligors are subject to ongoing monitoring and review, and may be assigned with new credit risk grades based on latest available information that better reflects their creditworthiness. The monitoring typically involves  the  use  of  information  obtained  during  periodic  review,  including  published  financial  statements, external  rating  (where  available),  as  well  as  qualitative  information  on  an  obligor's  industry  characteristics, competitive positioning, management, financial policy and financial flexibility.

## Definition of default

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default by assessing the following criteria:

## Quantitative criteria

For insurance receivables, the obligor is said to be in default if it fails to make contractual payments within 12 months after it falls due. For bonds and loans, the obligor is said to be in default if it fails to meet its contractual obligation and there are non-payments on another debt obligation of the same issuer to the Group.

## Qualitative criteria

The counterparty is in bankruptcy or has indications of potentially significant financial difficulty such as lawsuits or  similar  actions  that  threaten  the  financial  viability  of  the  counterparty;  distressed  exchange,  merger  or amalgamation without assumption  or breach of material loan covenants not rectified within a given timeframe, restructuring with expected principal haircut or a breach in material loan covenant that is not rectified within given timeframe.

The criteria above have been applied to all financial instruments held by the Group and are consistent with the definition of default used for credit risk management purposes. The default definition has been applied consistently to model the PD, EAD and LGD throughout the Group's expected loss calculations.

## Incorporating of forward-looking information

The Group incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and its ECL measurement. The Group has performed historical analysis and identified key economic variables impacting credit risk and ECLs for each portfolio.

These economic variables and their associated impact on the PD, EAD and LGD vary by financial instrument. Expert judgement has also been applied in this process. Forecasts of these economic variables (the 'base economic scenario') are obtained from publicly available economic databases published on a quarterly basis and provide the best estimate view of the economy over the next four to five years, after which, to project the economic variables for the full remaining lifetime of each instrument, a mean reversion approach is used. The impact of these economic variables on PDs, EADs and LGDs has been determined via regression analyses.

In addition to the base economic scenario, the Group uses multiple scenarios to ensure non-linear risks are captured. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reviewed at each reporting date. At 31 December 2020, for all portfolios, the Group concluded that two particular scenarios are capable of capturing non-linear risks  inherent  in  all  portfolios.  The  scenario  weightings  are  determined  by  expert  credit  judgement,  taking into account the range of possible outcomes the chosen scenario is representative of. The assessment of significant increase in credit risk is performed using the 12M PD under each of the scenarios multiplied by the associated scenario weights. This determines whether the whole financial instrument is in Stage 1, 2 or 3, and hence whether 12M or lifetime ECL should be applied. Following this assessment, the Group measures ECL as either a probability- weighted 12M ECL (Stage 1), or a probability-weighted lifetime ECL (Stages 2 and 3). These probability-weighted ECLs are determined by running each scenario through the relevant ECL model and multiplying it by the appropriate scenario weighting (as opposed to weighting the inputs).

As with any economic forecasts, the projections and likelihoods of occurrence are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and the actual outcomes may be significantly different from projected outcomes. The Group considers  these  forecasts  being  representative  of  the  best  estimates  of  the  possible  outcomes  and  has analysed the non-linear risks and asymmetries within the various portfolios of the Group to establish that the chosen scenarios are appropriately representative of the range of possible scenarios.

The sensitivity of the ECL to the economic variable assumptions affecting the calculation of ECL was not material to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020.

## 33 ENTERPRISE RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## Market and Credit Risk (continued)

- (i) Concentration risk. An important element of managing both market and credit risks is to actively manage concentration to specific issuers, counterparties, industry sectors, countries and currencies.  Both internal and regulatory limits are put in place to manage concentration risk. These limits are reviewed on a regular basis by the respective management committees. The Group's exposures are within the concentration limits set by the respective local regulators.

The Group actively manages its investment mix to ensure that there is no significant concentration in market and credit risk.

- (j) Sensitivity  analysis  on  financial  risks. The  sensitivity  analysis  below  shows  the  impact  on  the  Group's net profit after tax by applying possible shocks to each key variables, with all other variables constant. Comovement of key variables can significantly affect the fair values and/or amortised cost of financial assets. To demonstrate the impact due to changes in each key variable, the variables are changed individually.

The impact on net profit after tax represents the effect caused by changes in fair value of financial assets whose fair values are recorded in the Profit or Loss Statement, and changes in valuation of insurance contract liabilities. The equity sensitivity represents the impact on net profit after tax and the effect on changes in fair value of financial assets measured at FVOCI.

## 33 ENTERPRISE RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## Operational and Compliance Risk

Operational  risk  is  an  event  or  action  that  may  potentially  impact  partly  or  completely  the  achievement  of  the organisation's  objectives  resulting  from  inadequate  or  failed  internal  processes  and  systems,  human  factors,  or external events.

Compliance  risk  is  any  event  or  action  that  may  potentially  impact  partly  or  completely  the  achievement  of  the organisation's  objectives,  as  a  result  of  its  failure  to  comply  with  the  following  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards:

- local laws, regulations and rules governing licensed activities undertaken by Great Eastern;
- foreign laws, regulations and rules that have extraterritorial jurisdiction over Great Eastern's licensed activities;
- codes of practice promoted by industry associations of which Great Eastern are members of; and
-  any other applicable regulations which do not specifically govern the licensed activities undertaken by Great Eastern but can expose the organisation to legal, regulatory or reputational loss.

The  day-to-day  management  of  operational  and  compliance  risk  is  through  the  maintenance  of  comprehensive internal control frameworks, supported by an infrastructure of systems and procedures to monitor processes and transactions. GMC reviews operational and compliance issues on a group basis at its monthly meetings while local level issues are managed and monitored by the local SMTs. The Internal Audit team reviews the systems of internal controls to assess their ongoing relevance and effectiveness, and reports at least quarterly to the Audit Committee.

## Technology, Information and Cyber Risks

Technology  risk  is  defined  as  risk  related  to  any  potential  adverse  outcome,  damage,  loss,  disruption,  violation, system/hardware  failure,  capacity  deficiency  arising  from  the  use  of  technologies  such  as  electronic  hardware/ devices, software, online networks and telecommunications systems.

Information Risk is defined as risk related to confidentiality, integrity and availability of information (in physical or digital form).

Cyber Risk is  defined  as  risk  related  to  acts  perpetrated  by  malicious  threat  actors  including  internal  sabotage,  espionage, malicious attacks, hacking incidents, fraudulent conduct using information and communication technologies.

Great Eastern adopts a risk based approach in managing technology, information and cyber risks relating to cyberattacks, data loss/leakage, deficiency in change management, emerging technology, inadequate vendor management, inferior system acquisition and development, network security vulnerability, privilege access misuse, system security vulnerability, system unavailability and technology obsolescence. Key risk indicators related to technology, information and cyber risks are reported to the Board on a regular basis. Independent assessment is performed by Internal Audit for its adequacy and effectiveness.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 34 FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

## 34.1 Fair Value Hierarchy

The Group categorises fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs used as follows:

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date,

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for an asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, quotes from brokers and market makers, cash flow discounting and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants, and

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement would be categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).

## Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## 34 FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)

## 34.3 Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (continued)

## (ii) Valuation process:

Valuation of financial instruments are performed by custodian and the valuation of investment properties are performed by external valuer. The valuations of investment properties are based primarily on the comparable method, the income method and the residual method. The valuation by custodian is verified and assessed reasonableness by Group Investment Management department against available market condition. The major inputs of investment properties are verified against independent valuation reports and assessed reasonableness against property value of other comparable properties. Property department also held discussions with external valuer on the fluctuation noted.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 37 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD

We  view  the  COVID-19  pandemic  as  an  evolving  situation  with  continued  uncertainties  that  could  impact  the performance of the Group. There are still many unknowns surrounding the pandemic and the timing of its eradication remains uncertain. The impact to our business operations would hinge on each government's response to manage the health and economic effects of the pandemic.

We expect continued volatility in the financial markets, resulting in fluctuations in the mark-to-market valuation of our assets and liabilities, which will impact our profit. Key factors are the direction of interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices. As our bonds are mostly investment grade, the default risk is likely to be low.

## 38 AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At the Board of Directors' Meeting held on 22 February 2021, the Board authorised these financial statements for issue and that two Directors of the Board, Mr Koh Beng Seng and Mr Kyle Lee, sign the Directors' Report on behalf of the Board.
