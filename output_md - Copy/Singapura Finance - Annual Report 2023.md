## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

YU-FOO YEE SHOON NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN

On  behalf  of  the  Board  of  Directors, I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Annual Report  and  Financial  Statements  of the  Group  and  the  Company  for  the financial  year  ended  31  December 2023 ('FY2023').

![Image](output_md\Singapura Finance - Annual Report 2023_artifacts\image_000008_708666a80d3b4a356d5abbc0be4b39ebd19751d6887c6f3a892c511ab13872af.png)

Group continued to forge ahead with our digital transformation journey, total operating  expenses  remained relatively  consistent  as  compared  to last  year  with  a  decrease  of  0.4%  or $0.1 million.

## PERFORMANCE REVIEW

The  external  operating  environment for FY2023 continued to be challenging even as the world economy opens up post-pandemic. Cost of funds remains high due to interest rate hike to curb inflation.  Under this difficult business environment,  the  Group  recorded  a profit after tax of $6.2 million, a decline of  26.2%  compared  to  last  year.  The weaker performance was arising from lower  net  interest  income  as  higher cost of funds outpaced the increase in total interest income.

Net interest income and hiring charges declined  by  16.1%  to  $22.0  million compared  to  $26.2  million  last  year. Total  interest  income  rose  by  $14.1 million or 41.3% mainly attributed to  the  increase  in  interest  income from  loans  and  advances,  Singapore Government Securities ('SGS') and other  interest  earning  assets  amidst a  higher  interest  rate  environment. Correspondingly, total interest expense  increased  sharply  by  $18.3 million  or  232.7%  during  the  year. Non-interest income increased by $0.2 million or 22.7% mainly due to higher loan  administrative  and  penalty  fees earned on early settlement. While the

December 2022. In line with the lower loan balance, total customers' deposits were managed downwards by 1.8% to $878 million as at 31 December 2023 compared  to  $894  million  as  at  31 December 2022.

The net allowances for loans declined to $0.1 million for the year ended 31 December  2023  compared  to  $1.4 million  for  year  ended  31  December 2022 mainly due to lower allowances for  credit-impaired  loans  and  noncredit-impaired loans. The Group continues to set aside adequate specific  and  collective  allowances  in respect of its loan portfolio.

The Group's shareholders' funds remain robust at $253 million as at 31 December  2023,  and  are  more  than adequate to buffer further volatility in the current economic slowdown. Our capital adequacy ratio continues to be well  above  the  regulatory  minimum requirement.

Fair value reserve for the year ended 31 December 2023 increased by $0.1 million  due  to  increase  in  the  fair value  of  the  Singapore  Government Securities (SGS). The Group purchases SGS  for  the  purposes  of  maintaining minimum  liquid  assets  as  required under the Finance Companies Act.

The Group's total loan, net of allowances,  dipped  by  2.4%  to  $824 million as at 31 December 2023 compared  to  $844  million  as  at  31

## DIVIDENDS

Subject  to  approval  of  shareholders at  the  forthcoming  Annual  General Meeting, the Board is recommending a  first  and  final  one-tier  tax  exempt dividend of 2.0 cents per share and a special one-tier tax exempt dividend of 1.0 cent per share for FY2023. The total distribution of 3.0 cents per share for the year will amount to approximately $4.8 million.

## OPERATIONS REVIEW

Against the backdrop of a challenging global-macro environment  in 2023, the Group  continued to focus on our fundamentals by providing competitive rates despite the high interest rates environment and stood by our customers. We also continued to  harness  on  the  strengths  of  our fundamentals through enhancements on our web-based online services SFL Go and SFL IBiz with a focus on better experience for our customers.

The  Group  continued  to  forge  ahead with our digital transformation initiatives  and  remains  dedicated  to drive  the  digitalization  of  customer touch-points without compromising

## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

the security of transactions. Our journey  to  implement  digital  touch points adopts a security by design and zero-trust  strategies.  We  continue  to be vigilant and bolster our monitoring of cyber related security risks.

Regulators and stakeholders are increasingly taking into account the role financial institutions play in the development  of  sustainable economies.  The  Group  is  committed to  be  a  responsible  corporate  citizen and  is  actively  playing  our  part  to reduce our carbon footprint. In our  support  to  align  our  corporate philosophy, strategy and goals to the government's vision of green finance, we integrate environmental, social and governance factors in our risk and credit  assessment  under  the  Group's environmental risk management framework.

## OUTLOOK

The Singapore economy grew by 2.2% on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2023, accelerating from the 1.0% growth in the previous quarter. On  a  quarter-on-quarter  seasonallyadjusted basis, the economy expanded by 1.2%, slightly faster than the 1.0% growth  in  the  third  quarter.  For  the whole of 2023, the economy expanded by  1.1%,  moderating  from  the  3.8% expansion in 2022.

Despite the overall growth in the economy, Singapore narrowly avoided a  technical  recession  in  2023  amidst the tensions between the United States  and  China  coupled  with  the troubled international environment with conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.

As the economy  heads  into 2024 after  two  years  of  high  inflation  and interest  rate  hikes,  the  global  market sentiments  are  such  that  geopolitical tensions  will  continue  to  cloud  the global  market  outlook  for  2024.  High inflation from the past years are demonstrating a downward trend and is expected to continue to decline into 2024. Interest rates on the other hand are  expected  to  stay  high  but  with inflation  easing,  central  banks  may lower interest rates in the second half of 2024.

Global  growth  rate  is  forecasted  to slowdown  from  3.5%  in  2022  to  3% in 2023  and  2.9%  in 2024, falling below  the  historical  average  of  3.8% recorded from 2000 to 2019. Slowing growth  in  the  global  economy  along with  uncertainties  relating  to  change in political leadership  in significant economies around the world, geopolitical conflict and central banks policies on the existing persistent high interest rates are expected to impact customer behaviour on credit demand, both globally and in Singapore.

Given  the  modest  economic  outlook, the Group will be proactive in managing  our  net  interest  margin  in the  environment  of  volatile  interest rates  and  continue  to  manage  our risk exposures closely. The Group continues its aim to stay relevant and competitive  as  we  continue  to  forge ahead with our digital transformation to sustain the Group's long-term growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

## ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE

For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group recorded a profit after tax of $6.2 million, a decline of 26.2% compared to last year. The weaker performance was arising from lower net interest income as higher cost of funds outpaced the increase in total interest income.

Net interest income and hiring charges declined by 16.1% to $22.0 million compared to $26.2 million last year. Total interest income rose by $14.1 million or 41.3% mainly attributed to the increase in interest income from loans and advances, Singapore Government Securities ('SGS') and other interest earning assets amidst a higher interest rate environment. Correspondingly, total  interest  expense  increased  sharply  by  $18.3  million  or  232.7%  during  the  year.  Non-interest  income  increased  by $0.2 million or 22.7% mainly due to higher loan administrative and penalty fees earned on early settlement. While the Group continued to forge ahead with our digital transformation journey, total operating expenses remained relatively consistent as compared to last year with a decrease of 0.4% or $0.1 million.

The net allowances for loans declined to $0.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2023 compared to $1.4 million for year ended 31 December 2022 mainly due to lower allowances for credit-impaired loans and non-credit-impaired loans. The Group continues to set aside adequate specific and collective allowances in respect of its loan portfolio.

## FINANCIAL REVIEW

The  Group's  shareholders'  funds  remain  robust  at  $253 million as at 31 December 2023, and is more than adequate to buffer further volatility in the current economic slowdown. Our capital adequacy ratio continues to be well above the regulatory minimum requirement.

Fair  value  reserve  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2023 increased  by  $0.1  million  due  to  increase  in  the  fair  value of the SGS. The Group purchases SGS for the purposes of maintaining  minimum  liquid  assets  as  required  under  the Finance Companies Act.

The  Group's  total  loan,  net  of  allowances,  dipped  by  2.4% to $824 million as at 31 December 2023 compared to $844 million  as  at  31  December  2022.  In  line  with  the  lower loan  balance,  total  customers'  deposits  were  managed downwards by 1.8% to $878 million as at 31 December 2023 compared to $894 million as at 31 December 2022.

In the opinion of the Directors, no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen which is likely to  affect  substantially  the  results  of  the  operations  of  the Group and the Company in the interval between the end of the financial period and the date of this report.

Net interest  income  dropped by $4.2 million or  16.1%  for  the  year  ended  31  Dec  2023  compared  to  last  year  mainly attributed to higher of cost of funds which outpaced the increase in total interest income.

Total interest income rose by $14.1 million or 41.3% mainly attributed to the increase in interest income from loans and advances, Singapore Government Securities and other interest earning assets amidst a higher interest rate environment.

Correspondingly, total interest expense increased sharply by $18.3 million or 232.7% as our average cost of funds spiked from 0.9% to 3.1% during the year.

The Group's net interest margin as a percentage of the interest-earning assets has decreased to 2.00% from 2.35%.

Non-interest income for FY2023 increased by 22.6% to $0.9 million primarily attributed to higher number of prepayment of loans subjected to penalty fees and higher loan processing and acceptance fees.

| Total operating expenses | 15,362       | 15,427       | (0.4)        |

Operating expenses decreased by 0.4% compared to same period last year mainly due to lower staff costs.

| Total Write-back of/(Allowances for) Impairment Losses (Net) | (54)         | (1,422)      | (96.2)       |

The net allowances for loans and advances declined to $0.05 million  for  FY2023  compared  to  $1.42  million  for  FY2022 mainly due to a write-back on credit impaired loans of $0.04 million in FY2023 compared to a charge of $0.77 million last year  due  to  loans  redemptions  and  lower  allowances  on not-credit impaired loans. The Group continues to set aside adequate specific and collective allowances in respect of its loan portfolio.

| Total Equity   | 253,276      | 252,222      | 0.4          |

The increase in total equity was mainly due to the increase in the fair value reserve with the increase in the prices of Singapore Government Securities. These investments are held primarily for Minimum Liquid Assets ('MLA') purpose.

## BOARD STATEMENT

The  Board  of  Directors  ('the  Board')  is  pleased  to  present Singapura Finance Limited's ('SFL' or the 'Company') seventh Sustainability Report (this 'Report').

The long-term success of SFL is guided closely by our core values of Shareholder Value, People Development, Integrity, Customer Focus and Efficiency ('S.P.I.C.E') which emphasises the  creation  of  shared  values  for  our  stakeholders  and  a balanced focus on short and long-term business sustainability aspects.  SFL's  business  strategies  and  initiatives  are  also developed  in  alignment  with  these  core  values  to  enable sustainable value creation by SFL.

We place a balanced focus on both the financial and nonfinancial  performance  of  SFL  and  its  group  of  subsidiaries ('SFL Group' or the 'Group'), including environmental, social, and governance factors that have significant bearing on SFL's value creation.

The  Board  of  SFL  is  committed  to  continuously  enhance the  Group's  management  of  the  risks  relating  to  material sustainability factors and pursue opportunities in furtherance of SFL's value to stakeholders, as well as resilience to future uncertainties. This year, the SFL Board has also initiated efforts to  begin  incorporating  elements  of  the  Recommendations of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures ('TCFD  Recommendations')  in  acknowledgement  of  the Group's shared responsibilities, as well as keeping up with the local regulations, in combatting climate change.

We continued to validate the Group's material ESG factors via  the  materiality  assessment  process  and  carried  out management  and  monitoring  of  the  identified  material ESG  factors  which  are  disclosed  in  this  Report.  The  Board would like to extend its appreciation to all who have been supporting  SFL's  pursuit  of  its  sustainable,  shared  value creation purpose, towards which the Board will continue to drive the Group.

## ABOUT THIS REPORT

This Report covers the sustainability approach and performance  of SFL Group, including its key business activities in Singapore, i.e. deposit services and financing for businesses and individuals, for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 ('FY2023').

This Report is prepared in line with the sustainability reporting requirements of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited ('SGX-ST') and with reference to the GRI Standards, which  is  one  of  the  most  established,  widely  used  and recognised  international  sustainability  reporting  standards. We  believe  that  the  GRI  Standards  reporting  framework also enables  us  to  holistically  disclose  our  governance structures, management systems, policies, measures, targets and performance, as relevant to communicate SFL Group's sustainability process to stakeholders.

The preparation of this Report has also taken into consideration  elements  of  the  TCFD  Recommendations. In  the  preparation of this Report, we have also considered Practice  Note  7.6:  Sustainability  Reporting  Guide  of  the SGX-ST Mainboard Rules.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

This  Report  has  been  reviewed  by  the  Group's  internal auditors.  The  internal  review  conducted  by  the  internal auditor covers key ESG data disclosed in this Report, including the  data  collection  and  reporting  process.  SFL  Group's sustainability reporting process, in general, is also subject to internal reviews via the Group's internal audit activities from time to time.

We may consider seeking external assurance for our future Sustainability Reports when such a need arises.

This Report and additional corporate information are available on our Company's corporate website 1 .  SFL greatly welcomes our stakeholders' feedback and comments which can be directed to feedback@singapurafinance.com.sg.

## SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

The  Board  is  responsible  for  the  long-term  success  of  SFL and  this  includes  incorporating  appropriate  sustainability considerations in SFL's strategic objectives. The Board incorporates  short  and  long-term  sustainability  considerations in its review and approval of the Group's strategies and it also ensures a robust governance structure is in place to manage and monitor material ESG factors of the Group.

This year, SFL further reviewed and enhanced its governance structure  for  sustainability  to  emphasise  an  agenda  to consider climate-related impacts, including financial impacts. The Board, in its assessment and review of the SFL's strategic objectives, would consider the climate-related impacts on the Group's business model and operations and set objectives to address climate-related impacts.

The development of sustainability objectives and strategies, which  shall  be  approved  by  the  Board  is  driven  by  the Sustainability Steering Committee ('SSC'). The Chief Executive Officer is the Chairman of the SSC which comprises of  Senior  Management team who provides leadership and stewardship to the Management. The SSC is also responsible for  overseeing  the  execution  of  sustainability  strategies and  the  achievement  of  sustainability  and  climate-related targets set by the Board. Policies and procedures relating to sustainability matters are developed by the SSC before they are recommended to the Board for its approval.

The SSC also oversees the Group's stakeholder engagement efforts  to  ensure  stakeholders'  views  and  concerns  are adequately understood and that relevant information, including sustainability-related information, is communicated to stakeholders.

The SSC is supported by the Sustainability Task Force ('STF') whose principal role is to drive and execute the sustainability strategies  and  programmes  across  SFL  Group.  Members of  the  STF  include  representatives  across  functions  and

divisions  and  they  are  tasked  to  implement  the  relevant sustainability  initiatives,  plans  and  controls  within  their respective functions or divisions.

The  SSC's  responsibilities  include  performing  materiality assessment periodically to determine SFL Group's material ESG  factors  and  ensuring  the  associated  risks,  including climate risks, are addressed via the Group's risk management process. This year, the Management team further conducted an  assessment  to  examine  the  financial  impact  of  climaterelated risks to the Group's business operations.

Additionally,  the  Audit  Committee  also  has  a  responsibility to review the Group's sustainability reporting in relation to environmental,  social  and  governance  matters  to  ensure appropriate regulatory disclosures. The internal audit reviews the sustainability framework and reporting process, including the internal controls over the data collated and reported in this Report.

## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

SFL's  sustainability  depends on strong connections with our diverse range of stakeholders. We are committed to having effective and adequate engagement with our stakeholders to ensure we understand their views and expectations sufficiently and incorporate such considerations in our business strategies, operations and engagement with stakeholders.

In  addition,  we  also  strive  to  establish  and  maintain  open  and  transparent  channels  with  stakeholders  to  communicate relevant information, such as key information that facilitates stakeholders' informed decision-making.

Key views or expectations raised during stakeholder engagement activities are highlighted to the STF and/or the SSC, as appropriate, for consideration in the Group's strategies. Stakeholders' views and expectations are also considered in our materiality assessment.

SFL Group has identified five key stakeholder groups and how the Group engages with them and the key topics and concerns of our engagements are summarised in the following table ( Table 1 ).

## MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Materiality assessment is a process for identifying, assessing and prioritising ESG factors to determine the relative materiality of ESG factors and to facilitate efficient resource allocation.

A formal materiality assessment was first conducted in FY2017 to identify ESG factors that are most important to our business and stakeholders. The materiality assessment was conducted in alignment with the GRI's definition of materiality, considering impacts to the organisation and the stakeholders and alignment with our core values of S.P.I.C.E 3 and prioritised based on the following factors:

- SFL's existing risk analysis and disclosures and its long-term strategy vision;
- global and local emerging trends;
- main topics and future challenges for the financial services sector, as identified by peers; and
- insights gained from interactions with both internal and external stakeholders.

At SFL Group, materiality assessment is conducted or reviewed by the SSC annually, considering any key stakeholder views and expectations.

During FY2023, the SSC conducted a materiality assessment review of SFL Group's ESG factors which is presented in the materiality matrix ( Diagram 2 ).

ESG factors:

[GRI 3-3, GRI 2-27]

## Compliance

SFL  Group  operates  in  a  heavily  regulated  industry  and compliance with the various laws and regulations is paramount to ensuring operational continuity.

Compliance in SFL Group is guided by our Compliance Risk Management  Framework  which  sets  out  the  objective, governance and oversight structure, roles and responsibilities and  the  processes  for  compliance  risk  management.  The framework  serves  as  a  guide  to  the  Board  of  Directors, Management,  Compliance  Department  and  all  employees on key focus areas when managing compliance risks in SFL's operations.

Compliance  matters,  including  topics  such  as  anti-money laundering ('AML') and combating the financing of terrorism ('CFT'),  are  considered  and  incorporated  in  our  day-to-day business  operations,  in  the  form  of  policies,  controls  and procedures in our operational processes and systems. Specific risk assessments may also be carried out to address certain risks in a targeted manner. For example, Enterprise-Wide Risk Assessment ('EWRA') for AML is conducted annually.

Relevant controls are also  embedded  in  the  standard operating procedures  which  are established to  ensure employees carry out operational activities in a standardised manner. Employees are trained and briefed on these standard operating  procedures  and  compliance  matters  are  further emphasised. New employees are also required to attend an AML training conducted by the Compliance Department.

The Compliance Department plays an important role in  supporting  the  Group's  oversight  and  monitoring  of compliance-related  matters,  through  periodic  compliance checks to ensure standard operating procedures and policies are complied with by our employees.

The  Compliance  Department  regularly  keeps  itself  abreast with  any  updates  to  the  laws  and  regulations,  including through email alerts from the Monetary Authority of Singapore  ('MAS')  and  other  regulatory  bodies.  Steps  are taken to assess the implications and report to the Operational and Technology Risk Committee ('OPTECH'), which convenes every  two  months  and  the  Risk  Management  Committee ('RMC') on a quarterly basis. The Compliance Department is also responsible for updating and communicating any new regulations or changes to the regulations to the HODs where the  HODs  shall  develop  measures  to  satisfy  the  updated compliance requirements.

SFL  Group  targeted  zero  cases  of  significant  fines  or  nonmonetary sanctions for non-compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. During FY2023, the Group achieved the target with no such cases recorded.

## Ethical business practice

SFL  Group  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  we  conduct  our business with utmost integrity and upholding high standards of business ethics, in line with our core company values. We do not tolerate any form of corruption at SFL Group.

We have a Code of Conduct ('COC') that governs the ethical practices and behaviours of all our Directors, employees and business  operations.  The  COC  addresses  topics  including upholding  integrity  in  dealings  with  stakeholders,  avoiding conflict  of  interests,  safeguarding  confidential  information, prohibiting insider trading, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, AML  and  CFT,  no  discrimination,  anti-bullying  and  antiharassment including sexual harassment, prohibiting abuse of power and others. The COC is one of the first documents

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

a newly appointed Director or a new joiner will be introduced to in order to ensure they are aware of the Group's values and expectations with regard to business ethics.

Reviews  of  SFL's  scripless  shareholders  are  performed  to monitor any non-disclosure of shareholdings or transactions by our employees. The review aims to monitor compliance against  our  internal  guideline  which  prohibits  employees from dealing in SFL's securities during the period commencing one month before the announcement of half-yearly and fullyear financial results. In FY2023, all employees complied with the guidelines.

In relation to anti-bribery, SFL Group has established internal guidance  and  procedures  through  the  COC,  addressing transactions which are commonly used to facilitate bribery, such  as  gifts  and  entertainment,  business  commissions and kickbacks, facilitation payments and donations and  sponsorships.  Guidance  is  provided  to  specify  the circumstances  and  limits  within  which  certain  transactions are  permissible,  as  well  as  controls  to  minimise  the  risks of  bribery  such  as  declaration  requirements  and  approval limits. SFL views facilitation payments as bribes and prohibits the use of facilitation payments.

The Group's key policies relevant to ethical business practice are  accessible  on  our  internal  network  by  all  employees. These policies are regularly reviewed to ensure they are up to  date  and  reflect  the  latest  regulatory  developments.  All new joiners are required to attend AML/CFT training and to familiarise themselves with the above-mentioned policies.

In addition to training for new joiners, refresher training is also  provided  to  employees  from  time  to  time  to  instil  an ethical corporate culture and ensure employees are always aligned with the Group's ethical values.

During FY2023, all employees have attended AML/CFT and anti-corruption training.

Scam  alerts  are  displayed  on  corporate  website,  internet banking (mobile and desktop site) and social media platforms to  remind  and  educate  customers  to  be  vigilant  against scammers.

SFL  Group  endeavours  to  continue  to  explore  innovative solutions  to  elevate  customer  experience  to  our  diverse customers.

SFL  Group  has  also  established  various  communication channels,  such  as  our  website,  email,  feedback  forms  and social  media  to  engage  with  customers,  respond  to  their enquiries and obtain feedback from customers. All channels are monitored daily.

We have a Feedback and Complaint Handling Process which sets out the procedures as well as the timeframe to ensure customers' feedback or complaint is responded to in a timely manner. The procedures include steps to acknowledge the customers'  feedback,  investigate  the  case  and  make  an official reply to the customer.

All  complaints  and  feedback  are  forwarded  to  the  Risk Management Department ('RMD') who will further analyse if  additional  improvement  measures  are  required.  The Management,  RMD  and  Communications  Department  are updated on the Feedback and Complaint Handling Process annually.

In FY2023, SFL met its target to ensure all customers' feedback and  complaints  (if  any)  received  via  any  delivery  channels have been acknowledged and resolved promptly as per the Feedback and Complaint Handling Process.

## Customer Privacy and Data Security

Ensuring  the  safety  and  confidentiality  of  our  data  and customers'  data  and  information  is  very  important  to  us. This includes preventing data and system breaches, as well as ensuring customers' data is handled in accordance with the  applicable  personal  data  privacy  laws  and  regulations, including the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 ('PDPA') 8 .

In ensuring the Group is informed of changes in data securityrelated  laws  and  regulations,  the  Compliance  Department subscribed  to  the  MAS  mailing  list  for  regular  updates while the Accounts Department will check MASNET daily for any  announcements or circulars  and  forward  them  to  the Compliance Department.

At  SFL  Group,  we  have  various  policies  and  processes  to support our target of 'Zero Breach' on data privacy.

The handling and management of data security in governed by SFL's Information Security Policy which has been approved by the OPTECH and Risk Management Committee ('RMC'). We also have policies to guide the proper use of our IT system and devices, namely the Portable Storage Devices Policy and Mobile Device Acceptable Use and Security Policy.

Overall, the Data Protection Officer and Information Services Department  are  responsible  for  safeguarding  the  Group's data through stringent practices of data privacy and sensitive and  confidential  information.  The  Group's  employees  are trained and briefed on proper data handling and information protection, as well as the regulatory requirements relating to data privacy and security.

Measures are also taken to safeguard our IT system. Amongst others, Data Loss Prevention ('DLP') is implemented in our environment  to  monitor  data  transmission  activities  and prevent  data  leakage.  Periodically,  we  also  have  external professional service providers to carry out penetration tests on our internet-facing systems to assess the vulnerability of our systems and network. Potential improvement areas are also identified from time to time to enhance the security of our systems.

All  employees  are  required  to  attend  and  complete  an assessment on security awareness conducted by the Technology Security Team to enhance their understanding of privacy issues. Reminders are sent from time to time on security and privacy policies.

We  continued to maintain our target of having zero substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data in FY2023.

## RESPONSIBLE FINANCING

ESG factors:

Responsible Lending [GRI 3-3]

Marketing and Labelling [GRI 3-3, GRI 417-2, GRI 417-3]

Assessment for Agents and Customers [GRI 3-3]

As financiers, SFL supports customers, including individuals and businesses, through its lending business. In support of the  Association  of  Banks  Singapore  ('ABS')  Guidelines  on Responsible Financing, SFL acknowledges that its corporate responsibilities extend into ESG.

Various  policies  and  guidelines  govern  our  relationship with customers and our on boarding process incorporates customer  due  diligence,  including  Know  Your  Customer ('KYC') procedures and litigation search.

## Responsible lending

SFL practices responsible lending and we assess the credit profiles of customers to ensure they are able to undertake additional debt positions and repay their loans. Responsible lending  practices  are  also  in  line  with  our  Credit  Risk Management Policy which provides guidelines on establishing and  reviewing  risk  tolerance  parameters  within  our  credit strategy. The policy helps to ensure the creditworthiness of the customers before a credit agreement is entered into or significantly  increasing  the  customer's  credit  limit  and  this safeguards  SFL  from  taking  on  excessive  credit  risks  and safeguards the customers from taking on excessive debt.

For  credit-related  screening,  customers  such  as  individual applicants and personal guarantors are screened via Credit  Bureau  Singapore  ('CBS')  while  corporate  clients and  corporate  guarantors  are  screened  via  CBS  FICO 9 ,  as applicable.

Our lending activities are guided by SFL's approved lending guidelines which specify amongst others, the lending appetite for the various industries, credit profiles, collateral types and financing structures.

## Credit Risk Management

SFL Group's credit risk management is also supported by the various controls and procedures established across different function.

- The  Risk  Management  Department  ('RMD')  or  Credit Control Department ('CCD') performs independent assessments  for  loans  of  more  than  $5  million  on  an obligor  basis  and  for  loans  with  exception  from  the Company's lending guidelines.
- The Credit Control Committee  ('CCC') reviews and approves  monthly  monitoring  of  non-performing  loans ('NPL') and Watch-Lists of higher risk and special mention loans.
- Relationship  Managers  initiate  regular  visits  for  higher valued loans and customers in more high-risk industries such as oil and gas, construction and hospitality.
- The CCD proactively monitors payment patterns of loans and follow up on NPL as and when required on a daily basis.
- The  Credit  Review  Department  ('CRD')  reviews  loans on  a  periodic  basis.  Higher  risk  loans  such  as  special mention loans are reviewed more frequently. Cases that warranted further follow up actions are referred to the CCD and CCC.
- The CCC reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions at the monthly CCC meetings. CCC also reviews the watch lists of higher risk loans.
- In FY2023, we achieved our target to screen 100% of our new customers.

## Product disclosures and communications

We adhere to established marketing and advertising standards  presenting  clear  and  accurate  information  to enable  customers  to  make  informed  decisions  about  our products and services.

The  content  of  SFL's  marketing  materials  is  reviewed  and assessed by our Marketing Department and Communications Department for compliance, appropriateness and accuracy before they are published. The review by these departments also helps to enhance the quality of our communication to reach out to the targeted audience effectively and achieve the desired communication outcomes.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

Client-facing  employees  such  as  Relationship  Managers ('RM') play an important role in upholding SFL's responsible marketing practices. Our RMs are sufficiently trained to  communicate  with  customers  in  alignment  with  the marketing  and  advertising  guidelines  and  they  are  also briefed on the relevant products offered by SFL, as well as new products, if any.

During FY2023, we continued to achieve our target of having no  reported  incidents  for  non-compliance  with  voluntary codes  nor  non-compliance  with  regulations  resulting  in  a significant fine, penalty or warning in respect of product and service information and marketing communications.

## Assessment on Agencies and Property Agents

We collaborate with agencies for certain  products  such  as property  loans  and  hire  purchase.  Agencies  are  required to  be  screened and checked via our due diligence process before an engagement is entered into.

We also have other screening methods including background searches  on  property  agents  who  refer  property  loans  to SFL online to ensure they hold a valid licence issued by the Council for Estate Agencies ('CEA').

Our  due  diligence  searches  are  aimed  at  ensuring  we engage with reliable business partners whose practices do not contradict SFL Group's values, including in the areas of integrity and compliance.

## SUSTAINABLE FINANCING

In December 2020, MAS issued the Guidelines on Environmental  Risk  Management  for  Banks  which  aims  to enhance the banking sector's resilience to and management of environmental  risks  through  setting  out  sound  risk management  practices.  Furthermore,  SGX  has  also  issued the  amendments  to  the  SGX-ST  Mainboard  Rules  which require listed issuers to produce climate-related disclosures consistent with the TCFD Recommendations.

## SFL Group's Environmental Risk Management Framework

SFL's  Environmental  Risk  Management  Framework  details SFL's  governance  structure  and  the  responsibilities  of  the Board, management committees and Senior Management. It  also  sets  out  SFL's  ESG  risk  appetite,  ESG  borrower  and transaction  approval  and  reporting,  scenario  analysis  and stress  testing  in  the  overall  management  of  environment risks in SFL.

SFL adopts a three-lines-of-defence model in its management of environmental risks and Marketing Department forms the first line of defence. The Risk Management Department and

![Image](output_md\Singapura Finance - Annual Report 2023_artifacts\image_000028_5dda2cdc1516fa5d782c4a555b0c44ce08a09086ea19d1101f653ed66c771449.png)

Internal Audit performs the roles of the second and third line of defence, respectively.

SFL  adopts  MAS's  guidelines  in  managing  the  ESG  Risks arising  from  our  customers.  The  first  line  of  defence  is required  to  screen  and  assess  borrowers  or  corporate activities and document the ESG due diligence, via the Due Diligence  Checklist,  to  support  their  business  decisions. The  assessment  criteria  consider  the  borrower's  existing business operations, the activity that the borrower is seeking financing for, the position of borrower in the supply chain, past record of controversies, the responsiveness or capacity of the borrower in addressing ESG issues, amongst others.

SFL classifies a borrower's ESG risk as either unacceptable, high,  medium  or  low.  More  stringent  requirements  are placed for borrowers classified as high or unacceptable risks, if required. These includes additional due diligence, mitigative controls or lending conditions imposed on the borrower. SFL has in place an internal ESG reporting process to ensure that the information is captured and reported.

SFL's  commitment  to  Environment  Risk  Management  is embodied  in  SFL's  ESG  Risk  Appetite  Statement-  (i)  SFL will  uphold  the  highest  level  of  integrity  in  conducting its  operations  and  has  zero-tolerance  towards  partaking in prohibited practices (including regulation, sanctions, embargoes or similar measures issued by the MAS); (ii) SFL will seek to avoid financing projects or borrowers that knowingly and continuously break environmental laws and will avoid financing sectors with high ESG risk exposures (Agricultural, Energy  from  Fossil  Fuels/  Oil  and  Gas,  Mining  and  Metals, Chemical, Forestry, Defence, Waste Management and Infrastructure);  (iii)  Any  exception  would  require  mitigation including  action  plans  to  assist  the  borrowers  to  improve their sustainability profile and performance.

SFL also takes into consideration the sector's contribution to GHG emission, deforestation, air, water and earth pollution/ contamination and impact on biodiversity when evaluating if a sector is deemed to be of high risk.

## Taking into consideration climate-related risks

Alongside environmental risk considerations, the Management  has  undertaken  an  assessment  to  examine the  financial  impact  of  climate-related  risks,  particularly transition and physical risks.

The  climate-related  risk  assessment  focused  on  the  more significant  product  categories,  namely  hire  purchase  or block discounting for automotive vehicles, housing loans and loans relating to the building and construction sector which constitute majority of the Group's loan portfolio, considering exposures of these products in terms of credit, market and liquidity risks.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

The outcome of the climate-related risk assessment is summarised as follows:

Considering the assessment outcomes, SFL will continue to review and enhance its risk assessment and risk pricing processes. In addition, the Group will also incorporate such considerations when reviewing its strategy on product pricing and portfolio composition.

Moving  forward,  SFL  will  expand  its  scope  of  risk  assessment  in  relation  to  the  Group's  climate-related  financial  impact to holistically assess and plan for the Group's long-term sustainability, particularly in building resilience for the Group to appropriately manage possible climate risks. SFL will also expand existing practices towards a more robust lending practice in line with responsible lending trends in the banking industry. Moving forward, SFL plans to look out for opportunities for electric vehicle financing in the green financing space. Employees will be provided with training on sustainable finance to elevate our skills and capability.

## Energy and Emissions

SFL  Group  continued  to  make  the  necessary  efforts  to measure and monitor its energy consumption and associated emissions.  This  year,  we  continue  to  report  our  Scope  2 emissions. We have added Scope 1 emissions in this year and are currently developing processes to measure our Scope 3 emissions.

Energy  use  by  SFL  Group's  operations  is  mainly  derived from purchased electricity consumed at our Head Office, all Customer Centres and warehouse. We measure our energy data based on electricity bills.

We  continued  to  promote  energy-saving  practices  among employees, such as switching off air-conditioners and

SFL  Group's  annual  energy  consumption  for  FY2023  was recorded at 247,917 kWh, a 4.8% decrease from FY2022 and a 23% decrease from FY2017 ( Table 11 ).  The  lower energy consumption  during  the  year  could  be  attributable  to  our initiatives to convert our Head Office and all branches to LED lighting.

Energy  intensity  per  employee  also  reduced  by  5.7%  from FY2022  to  FY2023  with  an  overall  decrease  of  22.2%  from FY2017 to FY2023 ( Table 12 ). We achieved our target to limit the year's energy intensity to no more than 2% increase from the previous year.

Due to the lower energy consumption during FY2023, SFL Group recorded lower Scope 2 GHG emissions at 103 tCO 2 e, 2.8% lower than in FY2022. Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity reduced to 1.03 tCO 2 e/person, approximately 1% reduction from FY2022 ( Table 13 ).

## Water and Waste

Further efforts are undertaken to reduce our environmental footprint, reducing waste generation by adopting technology and digitalisation in our operational processes. Since 2020, 80% of SFL's marketing documentation process, including the submission of credit proposals, supporting documents and correspondences has gone paperless. We have also adopted Google Cloud, a carbon-neutral service provider, to host some systems and servers. This helps us to reduce our associated Scope 3 emissions as well as providing a more integrated information system platform to facilitate SFL's internal communications and documentation processes.

As part of our efforts to protect customer and business data, our paper waste is handled by an external service provider who performs shredding and recycles the shredded paper.

While water is not a material factor for SFL Group's operations, we chose to disclose water consumption data since FY2020 to promote awareness and report how we manage the use of water. We have been promoting and raising awareness of water conservation among our employees.

We only use water for domestic consumption at our Head Office and Customer Centres and we measure water consumption based on our water bills.

During FY2023, our water consumption increased by 5.1% to 466.0m 3 and water consumption per employee increased by 2.8% to 4.5m 3 per person. We will continue to assess initiatives to reduce water consumption and aim to maintain current consumption levels as per previous years.

Conversion factors used are derived from the Grid Emission Factors adapted from Singapore Energy Statistics 2019, Singapore Energy Statistics 2020, Singapore Energy Statistics 2021, Singapore Energy Statistics 2022 and Singapore Energy Statistics 2023 respectively. E.g. FY2023 adapts the latest Grid Emission Factor reported in Singapore Energy Statistics 2023.

SFL Group promotes diversity and upholds a no-discrimination principle in all its employment practices. We do not discriminate against anyone based on their gender, age group, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disabilities, or political and cultural beliefs. All  employment activities such as recruitment, assessment, promotion, remuneration, and disciplinary actions are based on merits such as skill sets, competency, performance, and contribution to the SFL Group. We believe in the benefits of a diverse workforce as they enable an inclusive environment where decision-making can take into consideration the diverse perspectives and different needs of the general public. The perspectives, experience, and cultural background of a diverse management team also allow decisions to be considered and risk-managed more holistically.

As of 31 December 2023, 18% of the Board is composed of female Directors; and 27% of the Board has an age between 30 to 50 years old ( Table 17 ). We also have a diverse workforce in terms of gender and age group ( Table 18 ).

ESG factors:

Occupational Health and Safety [GRI 403-9, GRI 403-10]

Training and Education [GRI 3-3, GRI 404-1, GRI 404-3]

SFL Group endeavours to create a respectful and conducive work environment. We respect all employees' fundamental human rights and practice good employment practices. As a progressive employer, SFL adopts the Tripartite Standards in Flexible Work Arrangements, Grievance Handling, Recruitment Practices, Work Life Balance and Unpaid Leave for  Unexpected Care Needs.  Through the Tripartite Standards, we aim to create and sustain an inclusive workplace, as well as promote the well-being of our employees.

In  recognition  of  the  experience  and  expertise  of  retired persons,  SFL  Group  extends  re-employment  opportunities to eligible employees upon their retirement and are usually employed  in  the  same  job.  Employee  beyond  retirement age  comprise  close  to  5%  of  our  workforce  and  we  have benefitted from their contribution and experience.

## Ongoing employee engagements

We maintain a collaborative relationship with our employees. SFL  Group's  success  depends  on  the  contribution  of  our employees  and  we  greatly  appreciate  the  contribution  of every employee. We strive to remunerate all employees fairly and support them in pursuing a quality work-life.

We  have  various  established  channels  to  engage  with employees with an aim to facilitate bi-directional communication and dialogue between SFL and the employees. We  adopt an open-door policy where all employees  are  encouraged  to  engage,  seek  clarification, initiate  discussions,  or  raise  concerns  on  how  business  is operated  at  SFL  Group.  We  also  encourage  employees  to share their views and experience, regardless of their position, as we believe all employees' views are valuable and we are receptive to the views of employees.

As our HR or HODs become aware of issues or topics which are important to address, information feedback sessions are conducted to communicate to employees the Group's views and  perspectives,  as  well  as  action  plans  to  address  such concerns.

Exit interviews are also  conducted  with  employees  to understand their reasons for leaving, for the SFL Group to understand employees' challenges and perspectives to improve its retention strategies.

From  time  to  time,  we  obtain  feedback  from  employees, as appropriate, to consult them pertaining to any intended changes to employment policies or practices, so their views and considerations can be incorporated into our decisions. When  developing  or  improving  employment  practices  or initiatives,  we  also  conduct  benchmarking  analysis  against industry practices and government initiatives.

We  have  adopted  a  flexible  approach  in  our  employee engagement and working arrangements to suit the current hybrid working models and different communication preferences of employees.

## Employee remuneration and wellbeing

SFL Group has a competitive remuneration policy to attract and retain talent. The Group's remuneration and benefits are benchmarked  against  compensation  reports  and  surveys, and  salary  and  variable  benefits  are  reviewed  regularly as  needed.  Employees'  remuneration  and  incentives  also include  portions  linked  to  the  employee's  performance  to reward performance and contribution fairly.

In  addition,  SFL  Group  also  offers  supportive  employee benefits  such  as  those  related  to  dental,  health  screening, insurance,  and  employee  wellness.  In  terms  of  working arrangements,  we  believe  in  work-life  balance  and  offer options  for  flexible  working  arrangements  for  employees. Depending  on  employees'  preferences,  we  have  different reporting times to suit the various flexible working arrangements.  With  such  arrangements,  employees  are better  able  to  balance  between  their  responsibilities  at work  and  their  responsibilities  at  home.  We  believe  such an  arrangement  also  helps  to  support  employees'  family development.

Flexible working arrangements are now accessible to more employees as SFL Group has streamlined the arrangement process. Now, employees only need to seek approval from their respective HODs and make arrangements according to the needs of their function or department, and we believe this  would  help  to  further  optimise  the  benefits  of  flexible working arrangement for both the employee and the Group. We also aspire to build better teamwork within teams and among employees, instilling  a  culture  of  togetherness  and mutual support. We aim to conduct at least 3 company events each  year  to  foster  a  sense  of  recognition  and  belonging among our staff.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

During FY2023, SFL Group carried out several company-wide events to bring together our people from the head office and the Customers Centres, as follows:

- CNY Chinese New Year Lohei Reunion Dinner
- SFL Team Bonding
- Company's  Year End Dinner

## Occupational Health and Safety

As SFL's operations are mostly office-based, we are not exposed to significant occupational safety risks. Nonetheless, as we operate in an environment that involves the handling of cash, we ensure we have adequate security measures at all our Customer Centres. To prepare for workplace emergency situations, we have equipped our head office and Customer Centres with first aid box. We also equip employees with the basic first aid knowledge and skills to respond to workplace emergencies. In FY2023, 7 employees attended the Basic First Aid+ AED training conducted by the Singapore Red Cross Academy.

In addition, we also have safety and health-related policies which provide guidance to employees on safety and health practices, addressing  topics  such  as  ergonomics,  protecting  employees'  safety  when  interacting  with  customers,  and  emergency management at Customer Centres. We have a target to maintain having no cases of work-related injuries and ill-health in our operations. In FY2023, we achieved our target.

SFL encourages our employees to exercise and stay healthy. Every year, SFL participates in the National Steps Corporate Challenge, organised by the Health Promotion Board to encourage the adoption of an active lifestyle.

## Training and Development

All  employees  are  subject  to  annual  performance  appraisals.  In  addition  to  performing  assessments  on  employees,  the performance appraisals also serve as forums where employees are able to share concerns and initiate discussions pertaining to the operations of the Group, to facilitate better understanding, discuss challenges, or express views and concerns. Having such a platform allows the Management to understand employees' perspectives as well as to drive improvement to business and operations.

In  addition,  the  appraisal  system  also  facilitates  employees'  goal  setting  and  receive  feedback  on  how  they  can  improve themselves to progress along their intended career path. In alignment with the roles and responsibilities of the employees and considering the employees' goals and career aspirations, targets are set and performance is assessed. The performance appraisal  process  is  properly  documented  to  serve  as  a  basis  for  any  further  actions,  such  as  promotion,  increment,  or performance improvement programme. To support the longer-term talent development and succession planning for SFL Group, employees with potential for preferred skill sets and qualities are further identified for development.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

Based  on  the  appraisals  and  taking  into  consideration  the  needs  of  employees  and  the  various  functions,  training  and development programmes are formulated. HR, together with HODs, may initiate relevant training courses or programmes for the respective employees or functions throughout the year. See Table 20 for examples of training provided.

Table 20 . Examples of training for SFL employees in FY2023.

For FY2023, all employees have gone through the mandatory training requirements for their roles ( Table 20 ).

|                                                       | Target   | FY2021   | FY2022   | FY2023   |

SFL Group carries out ongoing efforts to enable employees to attend training such as developing more online training to facilitate remote or online completion of training by employees.

We aimed to increase the average training hours per employee in FY2023. We attained approximately 9.45 training hours per employee in FY2023 ( Table 21 ) and we will continue to drive training participation and attendance in FY2024.

We have in place various schemes such as cross training and inter-departmental transfers to offer diversity and exposure to employees, so they can experience and be involved in different job positions and scopes. Such initiatives provide employees with new learning opportunities and cultivate their expertise. This platform also encourages meetings between colleagues from different departments which helps bridge interdepartmental understanding and synergies, as well as mutual understanding of how the overall operational processes may be carried out efficiently or enhanced. This will help to improve the camaraderie and collaborative culture within SFL. Furthermore, communicating with colleagues from other departments can inspire more creative solutions as they are able to offer fresh perspectives.

## SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITIES

Local Communities

[GRI 413-1]

SFL Group is keen to contribute to corporate social responsibility initiatives and we also encourage employees to volunteer to contribute to society, supporting those who need help. SFL has a Volunteer Leave scheme where employees can volunteer on a regular basis with approved charities and social enterprises.

In 2023, SFL created a Sponsorship for Aspiring Athletes. Through this newly debuted scheme, SFL hopes to ease some of the high barriers to entry, especially in terms of financial support, to cultivate young athletes looking to represent Singapore on the global sports map. This is part of our mission to empower youths in Singapore to pursue their dreams and be guided by a spirit of excellence that is also at the core of SFL. The first recipient of the sponsorship is 16-year-old budding Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu athlete, Jedd Tan as he embarks on a journey to represent Singapore in the international Jiu-Jitsu arena.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The profile of each Director, including professional qualifications, working experience, other directorships and principal commitments/appointments,  can  be  found  on  pages  4  to  7  of  this  Annual  Report.  The  Company  has  no  alternate director on its Board.

Under the Code, an independent director is one who is independent in conduct, character and judgment, and has no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers, that could interfere, or  be  reasonably  perceived  to  interfere,  with  the  exercise  of  the  director's  independent  business  judgement  in  the best interests of the Company. The NC annually reviews the independence of each Director by taking into account the definition of an independent Director and the relevant provisions and listing rules under the Code and the SGX-ST Listing Manual respectively.

The Independent Non-Executive Directors ('INEDs'), comprising majority of the Board, are able to exercise objective and independent judgment on matters of the Group. There is a strong independent element on the Board as at the date of this report.

Under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, a director will not be independent if he/she is employed by the company or any of its  related corporations for the current or any of the past three financial years, or, if he/she has any immediate family member who is employed or has been employed by the company or any of its related corporations for the past three financial years, and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee of the company.

The above provisions in the Code and the listing rules in the SGX-ST Listing Manual do not apply to any of the INEDs.

The NC takes into account the annual confirmation of independence completed by each INED. INEDs are required under the annual confirmation to critically assess their independence.

As non-executive members of the Board, the INEDs does not exercise management functions in the Company. However, all the Directors have equal responsibility and make contributions towards the performance of the Group.

The  Board  has  reviewed  and  assessed  the  independence  of  Mr  Adam  Tan  Chin  Han,  Mr  Terence  Khoo  Chi  Siang, Mr Lucas Tran Phuoc and Mr Loh Ching Soo (these Directors have each abstained from deliberation on their continued appointment) using a holistic approach. The assessments take into account their respective contributions in terms of experience, expertise, professionalism, integrity, objectivity and independent judgement in their engagement with all relevant parties, rather than solely and arbitrarily on basis of length of service alone.

All  the  INEDs are sitting in the respective Board Committees which require special skillset and experience and their contribution are still required at the Committees level. Their vast experience enables them to provide the Board and the  various  Board  Committees  which  they  serve,  with  pertinent  experience  and  competence  to  facilitate  sound decision-making. Their length of service does not in any way interfere with their exercise of independent judgement nor hinder their ability to act in the best interests of the Company.

The Board trust that they are able to continue to discharge their duties independently with integrity and competency. The Board considers its INEDs to be of significant influence and their views to be invaluable such that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the Board's decision-making processes.

As at the end of FY2023, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, have served on the Board for periods exceeding nine years from the date of their respective first appointments. Pursuant to SGX Listing Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) which came into effect on 11 January 2023, they will continue to be deemed independent until the Company's AGM held for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. As announced by the Company on 29 February 2024, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha will retire as directors of the Company at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, to be held on 25 April 2024 while Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has been re-designated to Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Board Composition and Diversity (Provision 2.4)

The  Board,  assisted  by  the  NC,  reviews  the  Board  size  and  composition  regularly  to  ensure  its  appropriateness  in facilitating robust engagement and effective decision-making under the Group's current scope and nature of operations and business requirements.

## Board Diversity

The Company recognises the need and benefits of embracing diversity at the Board level to enhance stewardship and decision-making capabilities that commensurate with the ever-evolving operating environment.

To promote diversity of the Board, the Company has adopted the Board Diversity Policy, taking into consideration from a number of aspects, including but not limited to:

- (a) age;
- (b) gender;
- (c) nationalities;
- (d) ethnicity;
- (e) experience;
- (f) educational background;
- (g) skills;
- (h) knowledge;
- (i) length of service;
- (j) independence (if applicable); and
- (k) other relevant qualities considered essential for the effective governance of the Company.

These aspects will be considered in determining the optimum composition of the Board.

Guided by the Company's Board Diversity Policy, the NC is cognisant of achieving an appropriately balanced mix of talent on the Board, comprising Directors with diverse but complimentary backgrounds and experiences. Selection of candidates will be based on a range of diversity perspectives as mentioned above. The ultimate decision will be based on merit and contribution that the selected candidates will bring to the Board.

## Board Composition

The  current  members  of  the  Board  are  prominent  business  leaders  and  professionals  with  financial,  banking  and business management backgrounds. Their diverse corporate experiences as a group provide core competencies relevant to the Group's business, and an appropriate balance of skills, experience, gender and knowledge of the Company. In recognition of the importance and value of gender diversity, the Board comprises two female Directors. In addition, the Directors with ages ranging from mid-40s to more than 70 years old, who have served on the Board for different tenures, with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, the Board members collectively provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group's business and direction.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Board, through the NC, has reviewed its composition, and is satisfied that the size of the Board is appropriate and adequate for effective decision-making having regard to its present scale of operations.

## Setting Targets, Plans and Timelines

The NC discuss and agree annually the relevant measurable targets for promoting and achieving diversity on the Board and make its recommendations for consideration and approval by the Board. The targets may involve at any given time, one or more aspects of board diversity with different timelines for achievement.

As part of its continuous effort in promoting diversity of the Board, the Company had set a target in FY2022 to include a Board member with experience/background in technology industry by 2024. The Board has fulfilled the target with the appointment of Mr Loh Ching Soo on 1 June 2023.

The current Board composition reflects the Company's commitment to Board diversity. Each year, the NC conducts its review of the composition of the Board which comprises members of both genders and from different backgrounds whose core competencies, qualifications, skills and experiences meet with the requirements of the Company at this point in time.

## Meeting of Independent Directors without Management (Provisions 2.5)

The  INEDs  constructively  challenge,  assist  with  development  of  strategic  proposals,  review  the  performance  of Management in meeting goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance.

The INEDs, led by the Lead Independent non-Executive Director ('LID') for FY2023, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, meet on a need basis without the presence of Management, in order to facilitate a more effective check on Management. The LID would provide feedback to the Executive Chairman after such meetings. No meeting of the Independent Directors was convened in FY2023.

Mr Adam Tan Chin Han was appointed LID on 29 February 2024.

## Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Principle 3:  There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

## Separation of Chairman and CEO (Provision 3.1)

During FY2023, the offices of the Executive Chairman and the CEO are held by separate individuals. Mr Teo Chiang Long is the Executive Chairman of the Company, while his son, Mr Jamie Teo Miang Yeow is the CEO.

## Lead Independent Director (Provision 3.3)

During  FY2023,  as  the  Executive  Chairman  and  the  CEO  are  immediate  family  members  and  are  both  part  of  the executive management team, the NC has appointed Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon as the LID (i) to serve as the principal liaison on Board issues between the INEDs and the Executive Chairman, and (ii) to address any queries and shareholders' concerns which contact through the normal channels of the Executive Directors has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate. On 29 February 2024, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han was appointed as the LID.

Shareholders may reach the LID at leadid@singapurafinance.com.sg .

## Roles of Chairman and CEO (Provision 3.2)

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and the CEO, which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board.

The  Executive  Chairman  leads  the  Board  to  monitor  and  review  the  general  progress  and  long-term  development of  the  Company. He ensures the members of the Board receive accurate, timely and clear information, in particular, the Company's performance, to enable the Board to make sound decisions, monitor effectively and provide advice to promote the success of the Company. He also encourages constructive relations between the Board and Management, and between the executive and non-executive Directors.

The CEO manages the daily operations of the Group and implements the Board's policies and decisions.

## Board Membership

Principle  4:    The  Board  has  a  formal  and  transparent  process  for  the  appointment  and  re-appointment  of directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the Board.

## Composition of the NC (Provision 4.2)

The NC comprises the following ten members, majority of whom are INEDs. The LID, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han, is the Chairman of the NC.

Mr Adam Tan Chin Han

(Chairman) (appointed as Chairman on 29 February 2024)

Mr Jamie Teo Miang Yeow

(appointed as member on 29 February 2024)

Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon

(re-designated as member on 29 February 2024)

Mr Teoh Eng Hong

Mr William Ho Ah Seng

Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha

Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang

(appointed as member on 1 June 2023)

Mr Lucas Tran Phuoc

(appointed as member on 1 June 2023)

Dr Christopher Teo Miang Chneh

(appointed as member on 1 July 2023)

## Role and Responsibilities of the NC (Provision 4.1)

Based on its TOR, the principal functions of the NC include:

- l reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board, taking into account, aspects of Board diversity, and making recommendations to the Board with regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary;
- l identifying and nominating for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when they arise;

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

- l determining annually, and if circumstances require, the independence of a Director;
- l reviewing the ability of a Director to adequately carry out his duties as Director when he has multiple board representations;
- l reviewing and recommending the nomination for re-appointment of Directors;
- l reviewing the succession planning of the Board and KMP;
- l assessing the effectiveness and performance of the Board, Board Committees and individual Directors;
- l reviewing and recommending relevant matters relating to Board diversity;
- l reviewing the training and professional development programs for the Board; and
- l reviewing its TOR to ensure alignment with the Code.

None of the Directors has an alternate Director. As a Director is expected to be able to commit time to the affairs of the Company, the NC will generally not support the appointment of an alternate Director.

## Selection, appointment and re-appointment of Directors (Provision 4.3)

Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors

The NC reviews and assesses the Board composition and recommends the appointment of new Director(s) for the Board's consideration. In doing so, the NC will:

- (a) consider  the  range  of  diversity  aspects  in  particular,  skills,  knowledge,  experience  including  familiarity  in the Company's core markets, age, gender and length of service, and assess the combined factors against the requirements needed to govern and direct the Company's strategic objectives.
- (b) identify and nominate suitable candidates to the Board based on merit and independence, and against objective criteria while paying due regard to the need for diversity on the Board.

The  channels  used  in  searching  for  appropriate  candidates  would  include  third  party  search  firms  and  personal networks. Any search firm engaged to assist the Board or Board committees in identifying candidates for appointment to the Board will be specifically directed to include diverse candidates.

The NC identifies and interviews short-listed candidates before recommending them for appointment formally to the Board and where applicable, to the Board Committees.

In reviewing and recommending any new Director appointment, the NC takes into consideration the current Board size and its mix, the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple Board representations, the additional skills  and  experience that will bolster the core competencies of the Board, the search process for the identification of suitable candidates and once identified, the appropriate knowledge, experience and skills of the candidates who in its opinion, are fit and proper and qualified for office. As the Company is a finance company as defined under the Finance Companies Act 1967 of Singapore, in accordance with the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS') Notice 817, all new appointments to the Board are subject to the approval of the MAS.

The decision on selection of new Director(s) will be based on merit against objective criteria that complements and expands the skills and experience of the Board as a whole having considered the overall balance and effectiveness of a diverse Board.

## Re-appointment of Directors

Under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, all Directors are required to submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election at least once every three years. Article 97 of the Constitution requires one-third of the Directors, or the number nearest to but not less than one-third, to retire by rotation at every AGM. These Directors may offer themselves for re-election, if eligible.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The  NC  reviews  annually  the  nomination  of  the  relevant  Directors  for  re-election  or  re-appointments  as  well  the independence of Directors. When considering the nomination of Directors for re-appointment, the NC takes into account their contribution to the effectiveness of the Board as well as their time commitment especially for Directors who have multiple board representations, and also reviews their independence.

The NC had recommended to the Board that Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, and Mr Jamie Teo Miang Yeow retire pursuant to Article 97 of the Constitution at the upcoming AGM. Pursuant to Article 103 of the Constitution, every newly appointed Director shall hold office only until the next AGM and retire from office, and for this purpose, Mr Lucas Tran Phuoc, Mr Loh Ching Soo and Dr Christopher Teo Miang Chneh shall retire at the forthcoming AGM.

Messrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Jamie Teo Miang Yeow, Lucas Tran Phuoc, Loh Ching Soo and Dr Christopher Teo Miang Chneh had consented to act and offered themselves for re-election. Each of them had abstained from the discussion and recused from voting in respect of his/her own nomination.

Pursuant to Rule 720(6) of the Listing Manual, detailed information of the Directors who are proposed to be re-elected to the Board is set out at pages 139 to 149 of this Annual Report.

## Succession Planning for the Board, the Board Chairman and Senior Management

The Board believes in carrying out succession planning for itself, the Board Chairman and the Senior Management team to ensure continuity of leadership. Board renewal is a continuing process.

The NC reviews annually the composition of the Board and Committees and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment of new Directors, whether in addition to the existing Board members or as replacement of retiring Board members, with a view to identifying any gaps in the Board's skills set taking into account the Group's business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding any resignation or retirement of any Director given the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board.

## Directors' other directorships and principal commitments (Provision 4.5)

Where a Director has multiple Board representations, the NC also considers if such a Director is able to adequately carry out his/her responsibilities as a Director of the Company.

The Board has set a general guideline that the maximum number of listed company board representations which a Director  may  hold  (including  representation  on  the  Company's  Board)  should  not  be  more  than  seven.  These guidelines were established following the careful assessment by the NC and the Board after taking into consideration the scope and complexity of the Company's business. Where there is a potential conflict of interest in accepting a new appointment on the board of other listed companies, assessment through the NC and the approval of the Board are required prior to accepting that appointment.

All Directors have met the requirements under the guidelines. The Board is satisfied that each Director has committed sufficient time to the Company and has contributed meaningfully to the Company. Details of the Directors' professional qualifications, working experience, and other directorships and principal commitments/appointments can be found on pages 4 to 7.

## Determining Directors' Independence (Provision 4.4)

The  NC  is  also  responsible  for  determining  annually,  and  as  and  when  circumstances  arise,  the  independence  of Directors.

On an annual basis, each ID is required to complete a declaration of independence based on the provisions in the Code and the Listing Rules, for the NC's review. The NC takes into account the principles and guidelines set out in the Code and the Listing Rules and assessed the independence of Directors based on the following considerations:

- (a) whether the Director has a relationship with the Company or its related corporations, substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere with the exercise of his/her independent judgement in the best interests of the Company;

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

- (b) whether the Director is or has been employed by the Company or any of its related corporations in the current or immediate past financial years;
- (c) whether the Director has an immediate family member who is or has been employed by the Company or any of its related corporations in the current or any of the past three financial years, and whose remuneration is or was determined by the RC;
- (d) whether the Director or his/her immediate family member has, in the current or immediate past financial year, provided to or received from the Company or any of its subsidiaries any significant payments or material services, other than compensation for Board service;
- (e) whether the Director or his/her immediate family member, in the current or immediate past financial year, is or was, a substantial shareholder or a partner in (with 5% or more stake), or an executive officer of, or a director of,  any organisation which provided to or received from the Company or any of its subsidiaries any significant payments or material services;
- (f) whether the Director has been a Director on the Board for an aggregate period of more than nine years; and
- (g) any other applicable circumstances.

The  NC  has  reviewed  and  ascertained  that  the  INEDs  continue  to  remain  independent  having  considered  their confirmation that they do not have any relationship with the Company, its related companies, substantial shareholders, or officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Directors' independent business judgement with a view to the best interests of the Company and the Group, and the other considerations set out above.

## Board Performance

Principle 5:  The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

Assessing the effectiveness of the Board, Board Committees and Individual Directors (Provisions 5.1 and 5.2) The Company has in place a formal process for assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the Board Committees and the contribution by each Director to the effectiveness of the Board.

The  NC  assesses  the  Board's  performance  as  a  whole  annually  using  objective  and  appropriate  quantitative  and qualitative  criteria  and  approved  by  the  Board.  When  assessing  the  overall  Board  performance,  the  NC  takes  into consideration the feedback from individual Directors on areas relating to the Board's competencies and effectiveness. The results  of  the  overall  evaluation  including  its  recommendations  for  improvements,  if  any,  are  presented  to  the Board.

The  NC  assesses  the  performance  of  all  the  Board  Committees  with  the  assistance  of  self-assessment  checklists completed by each of the Board Committees.

The annual evaluation process for each individual Director's performance comprises three parts:

- (a) background  information  concerning  the  Director  including  his/her  attendance  records  at  Board  and  Board Committee meetings;
- (b) questionnaire for completion by each individual Board member; and
- (c) the NC's evaluation based on certain assessment parameters.

The  questionnaires  and  the  assessment  parameters  were  recommended  by  the  NC  and  approved  by  the  Board. The completed questionnaires are then reviewed by the NC before the NC completes its evaluation of the individual Directors.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The results of the individual evaluation of each of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Board Chairman, to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Board Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the re-appointment and re-election of retiring Directors. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board.

## Board Evaluation Criteria

The qualitative criteria are set out in a questionnaire covering three main areas relating to Board composition, roles and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information.

The  quantitative  criteria  used  to  evaluate  the  overall  Board  performance  comprises  performance  indicators  which include a comparison of the Company's performance for the financial period under review against the performance of the Company and industry peers for the corresponding period over the past five years and the longer-term indicators such as the Company's total shareholder return over a five-year period.

## Board Committee Evaluation Criteria

The qualitative criteria are set out in a questionnaire covering areas relating to composition of the Board Committee, its roles and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information.

## Individual Director Evaluation Criteria

Factors taken into account in the assessment of a Director's performance include his abilities and competencies, his objectivity and the level of participation at Board and Board Committee meetings including his contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Company.

## REMUNERATION MATTERS

## Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies

Principle 6:  The Board has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors and key management personnel. No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

## Composition of the RC (Provision 6.2)

The RC comprises the following nine members, majority of whom are INEDs:

Mr Loh Ching Soo

(Chairman) (appointed as member on 1 June 2023 and Chairman on 29 February 2024)

Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon

Mr Adam Tan Chin Han

Mr Teoh Eng Hong

(re-designated as member on 29 February 2024)

Mr William Ho Ah Seng

Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha

Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang

Mr Lucas Tran Phuoc

(appointed as member on 1 June 2023)

Dr Christopher Teo Miang Chneh

(appointed as member on 1 July 2023)

## Role and responsibilities of the RC (Provision 6.1)

Based on the TOR approved by the Board, the principal functions of the RC are:

- l reviewing  and  recommending to the Board a framework of remuneration policies for Directors and KMP as defined in the Code;
- l reviewing and recommending to the Board the specific remuneration packages and terms of employment of each Director and KMP, covering all aspects of remuneration including but not limited to Directors' fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options and benefits-in-kind;

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

- l reviewing  and  recommending  to  the  Board  the  setting  up  of  share  option  schemes  or  long-term  incentive schemes;
- l reviewing the Group's remuneration and benefits policies and practices, including any share plans and/or other long-term incentive schemes;
- l proposing, for adoption by the Board, measurable, appropriate and meaningful performance criteria to assist in the evaluation of the performance of KMP, individual Directors and of the Board as a whole; and
- l reviewing the obligations of the Group arising in the event of the termination of the contracts of service of EDs and KMP to ensure that such contracts of service contain fair and reasonable termination clauses which are not overly generous.

## Remuneration Framework (Provision 6.3)

There  is  a  formal  and  transparent  process  for  developing  executive  remuneration  and  for  determining  the remuneration packages of individual Directors. No Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration. The RC's recommendations are submitted for endorsement by the Board.

The RC reviews all matters concerning the remuneration of the INEDs to ensure that remuneration commensurate with their contributions, responsibilities and market benchmarks.

None of the INEDs has service contracts or consultancy arrangements with the Company. They are paid Directors' fees based on a structured fee framework reflecting the responsibilities and time commitment of each Director.

The  annual  quantum  of  Directors'  fees  to  be  paid  is  reviewed  by  the  RC  and  the  Board  before  submission  to shareholders for approval at the Company's AGM.

The remuneration packages of executive Directors and KMP are approved by the Board upon recommendations by the RC. The Executive Chairman and the CEO do not participate in discussion of their compensation packages. The two executive Directors and most KMP are on service contracts with fixed appointment periods. The RC reviews the service contracts of executive directors and KMP to ensure that they do not contain onerous removal clauses.

There are no contractual provisions to allow the Company to reclaim incentive components of remuneration from the executive Directors and KMP in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial statements, or of misconduct resulting  in  financial  loss  to  the  Company.  The  RC  is  of  the  view  that  such  claw  back  provisions  are  not  necessary because the variable components of their remuneration packages are moderate.

## RC access to expert professional advice (Provision 6.4)

The RC may from time to time seek expert advice from external consultants whenever required. No external consultant was engaged in FY2023 to provide remuneration advice.

## Level and Mix of Remuneration

Principle 7:  The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and key management personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the company, taking into account the strategic objectives of the company.

## Remuneration Policy of Directors and Key Management Personnel ('KMP') (Provisions 7.1 to 7.3)

The Group's remuneration policy aims to provide compensation packages at market rates which reward successful performance and attract, retain and motivate Directors and KMP.

## Fixed and Variable Components

The compensation packages for executive Directors and KMP comprise a fixed component (in the form of a base salary and fixed allowances) and a variable component (comprising short-term incentives in the form of year-end and variable bonuses and benefits-in-kind, where applicable). The variable components take into account, amongst other factors, the executive Directors' and KMP's performance, and the Company's performance and industry practices.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

In  determining  the  variable  incentives  for  an  executive  Director  and  a  KMP,  his/her  individual  performance  and contribution  is  taken  into  consideration  together  with  the  competitive  market  practices  and  information  gathered from market surveys conducted by the Company's Human Resources department. This is then reviewed along with the Company's performance, taking into consideration specific indicators tracked over time which align with shareholders' interest, risk policies of the Company which promote the long-term success of the Company. Besides profitability, the quality of the Company's core business is also taken into account with the monitoring of the size and robustness of its  loan assets and the level of non-performing loans.  Based on its assessment, the RC believes that the performance conditions used in determining the variable components of executive Director and KMP have been met.

## Directors' Fees

Both executive and non-executive Directors receive Directors' fees which are subject to approval by shareholders. When reviewing the structure and level of Directors' fees, the RC takes into consideration the Directors' respective roles and responsibilities in the Board and Board Committees, effort and time spent, and changes in the business, corporate governance practices and regulatory rules.

The  RC  also  compares  the  Company's  fee  structure  against  industry  practices  and  ensures  that  the  non-executive Directors are not over-compensated to the extent that their independence may be compromised.

Other factors taken into consideration in the fee review includes frequency of Board and Board Committee meetings, corporate performance for the financial year under review as well as the corporate and economic outlook in the new financial year, and the interval since the last fee review. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.

There are no schemes to encourage non-executive Directors to hold shares in the company so as to better align the interests of such non-executive Directors with the interests of shareholders. However, the Company does not discourage the Directors from holding shares in the Company.

The RC has recommended that the Board tables for shareholders' approval at the AGM, the payment Directors' fees of S$580,000 for FY2023 and an ex-gratia payment to the retired and retiring directors at $180,000 each.

No member of the RC is involved in deliberating and deciding on his/her remuneration, compensation or any other form of benefits. The Board concurred with the RC that the proposed Directors' Fees for FY2023 are appropriate and not excessive, taking into consideration the level of contributions by the Directors, the effort and time spent serving on the Board and Board Committees as well as the responsibilities and obligations associated with their duties as Directors. The recommendations would be tabled at the forthcoming AGM for shareholders' approval.

## Long-term Incentive Scheme

Staff retirement gratuity is the only long-term incentive scheme of the Company. Staff (including executive Director and KMP) who are employed before 28 December 2002 are entitled to the staff retirement gratuity if they have worked for at least 12 continuous years prior to retirement. The Company does not offer shares or grant options with vesting period or employees share scheme to its Directors and staff.

## Disclosure on Remuneration

Principle  8:    The  company  is  transparent  on  its  remuneration  policies,  level  and  mix  of  remuneration,  the procedure  for  setting  remuneration,  and  the  relationships  between  remuneration,  performance  and  value creation.

## Disclosure of the remuneration of Directors and Key Management Personnel (Provisions 8.1 and 8.3)

## Remuneration of Directors

Details  of  Directors'  remuneration  for  FY2023  is  set  out  below.  The  disclosure  is  provided  to  enable  a  better understanding of the link between the remuneration paid to Directors, CEO and KMP and the performance of the individual and the Group. The criteria in setting the remuneration are disclosed under Principle 7 above.

## Note:

- (a) These  relate  to  provision  for  long-term  incentive  scheme  and  staff  retirement  gratuity.  No  staff  retirement  gratuity  and termination benefits were paid to any Directors during FY2023. Other Benefits also includes an amount relating to provision for one-time payment of Directors' Ex-Gratia to retired and retiring directors which will be tabled for shareholders' approval at the forthcoming AGM.
- (b) These  fees  comprise  Directors'  fees  for  FY2023  which  are  subject  to  approval  by  shareholders  as  a  lump  sum  at  the forthcoming AGM.

The Code recommends that the Company should fully disclose the remuneration of each individual Director and the CEO on a named basis. The Board is of the view that such disclosure would not be in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders.

Taking into account the details disclosed in the table above as well as note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements which  provides  an  appropriate  balance  between  detailed  disclosure  and  confidentiality  in  the  sensitive  area  of remuneration, the Board is of the view there is sufficient transparency and information on the remuneration policies, level  and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation which are consistent with the intent of Principle 8 of the Code. In arriving at its decision, the Board also took into consideration the competitive business environment in which the Group operates, and the negative impact such disclosure may have on the Group.

The Company is cognisant of the amendment to the Listing Rule on remuneration disclosures which will apply to annual reports for the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2024, where the Company is required to disclose the exact amount and breakdown of remuneration paid to directors and the CEO. The Company will make the appropriate disclosure when the Listing Rule is effective.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Remuneration of Key Management Personnel (not being a Director or CEO)

The Code recommends that the Company should name and disclose the remuneration of at least the top five KMP (who are not Directors or the CEO) in bands of $250,000/-. In addition, the Company should also disclose in aggregate the total remuneration paid to these KMP. As the Company only has two KMP, the Board is of the view that disclosure of the total remuneration of the KMP would be disadvantageous to the Group's business interests, given the prevailing highly competitive industry conditions. The remuneration of one of the KMP in the Company is below $250,000/- while the other is between $250,000 and $500,000. Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements provides an appropriate balance between detailed disclosure and confidentiality in the sensitive area of remuneration.

## Remuneration of Immediate Family Member of a Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder (Provision 8.2)

The  Code  also  recommends  disclosure  of  the  name  and  remuneration  of  employees  who  are  immediate  family members of a Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder of the Company, whose remuneration exceeds $100,000/during  the  year,  in  bands  $100,000/-.  Excluding  Mr  Teo  Chiang  Long  (who  is  the  father  of  both  Mr  Jamie  Teo  and Dr Christopher Teo Miang Chneh), Mr Jamie Teo and Dr Christopher Teo Miang Chneh (who are brothers), there were no employees of the Group who are immediate family members of a Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder and whose remuneration exceeded $100,000/- during the financial year.

## ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

## Risk Management and Internal Controls

Principle 9:  The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

## Design, Implementation and Monitoring of Risk Management and Internal Control Systems (Provision 9.1)

## Accountability of Board and Management

The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility to ensure accurate financial reporting for the Group.

The Board provides shareholders with semi-annual and annual financial results. In presenting these statements, the Board aims to provide shareholders with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance and position with a commentary at the date of announcement of the competitive conditions within the industry in which it operates.

Management provides all Directors periodically with accounts and reports on the Group's financial performance and commentaries on the competitive conditions within the industry in which the Group operates, which are reviewed by the AC and Board at its meetings prior to release of the announcements on the Group's semi-annual and full-year results. Periodic reports covering the Group's financial performance are also provided to all Directors. Apart from the periodic updates provided by Management, the Directors may at any time seek further information from, and discuss with, Management on the Group's operations and performance.

## Separate Risk Management Committee

The Board is fully committed to the implementation of sound risk management policies and practices, which are aligned to the Group's overall business strategy and objectives. The Board determines the type and level of business risks that the Group undertakes. Annually, the Board, assisted by the RMC, reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls.

The RMC assists the Board in overseeing risk governance in the Group's business and operations and ensuring that Management maintains a robust risk management framework with strong internal controls to safeguard shareholders' interests and the Group's assets.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The RMC comprises the following ten members:

Mr Adam Tan Chin Han

(Chairman)

Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon

(appointed as member on 29 February 2024)

Mr Teoh Eng Hong

Mr William Ho Ah Seng

Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha

Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang

Mr Jamie Teo Miang Yeow

Mr Loh Ching Soo

(appointed as member on 1 June 2023)

Mr Lucas Tran Phuoc

(appointed as member on 1 June 2023)

Dr Christopher Teo Miang Chneh

(appointed as member on 29 February 2024)

## Roles and Responsibilities of RMC

Based on its TOR, the principal functions of the RMC include:

- l reviewing  and  submitting  for  Board  approval  the  Group's  overall  risk  management  framework,  policies, procedures and limits and any changes thereof;
- l reviewing and guiding Management in the formulation of the Group's risk policies and in the execution of risk assessment processes and mitigation strategies;
- l monitoring and managing the risk exposures of the Group;
- l reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's risk management system; and
- l reviewing and ensuring that the proposed annual budget is aligned with the Company's objectives and strategy and is consistent with the Company's risk tolerance and risk profile prior to recommending to the Board for further deliberation and approval.

The RMC has, in turn, appointed the Credit Control Committee, Credit Portfolio Committee, Asset-Liability Committee and Operational &amp; Technology Risk Committee to assist in fulfilling its roles.

## Risk management and internal control systems

The key risks of the Group include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational and technology risk and compliance risk.  Risk  management  is  an  ongoing  process.  Continuous  efforts  are  being  made  to  ensure  that  the  Group's  risk management system and processes are in line with industry best practices.

## Credit Risk

Counter-party risk or Credit risk is the risk arising from the uncertainty of an obligor's ability to perform its contractual obligations. The Group's credit risk primarily stems from lending activities.

The two management committees assisting in the management of credit risk are the Credit Control Committee and Credit Portfolio Committee.

The Credit Control Committee ('CCC') reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions.

The Credit Portfolio Committee ('CPC') manages risk on a portfolio-wide basis and recommends alternative portfolio strategies, analyses the results of portfolio management actions, and develops portfolio limits for each portfolio segment for approval by the RMC. The CPC recommends the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, credit risk policies and manuals for approval by the RMC.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Risk parameters for accepting credit risk are clearly defined and are supported by written policies and processes in the Lending Guidelines to ensure that the Group maintains a well-diversified and high-quality loan portfolio.

The credit control functions ensure that credit risks are closely monitored and managed in compliance with the Group's credit policies and guidelines.

Credit reviews are carried out regularly to proactively identify and address potential weakness in the credit process and to pre-empt any unexpected deterioration in credit quality.

Credit  stress  tests  framework  is  in  place  to  analyse  the  impact  of  plausible  adverse  scenarios  on  the  Group's  loan portfolio.

The Group addresses credit concentration risk by setting and monitoring credit portfolio and industry mix limits on a regular basis.

Continuous efforts are being made to further enhance the Group's credit risk management processes.

The  SFRS(I)  9  Committee  ('SC')  supports  the  Board  and  the  AC  in  achieving  compliance  with  Singapore  Financial Reporting Standards (International) 9 Financial Instruments ('SFRS(I)9') which came into effect from 1 January 2018. SFRS(I) 9 requires, amongst others, an expected credit loss ('ECL') model for calculating impairment of financial assets.

The SC works closely with CPC and CCC to ensure that the Group has appropriate credit risk practices, including an effective  system of internal control, to consistently determine adequate allowances in accordance with the Group's policies and procedures relating to impairment allowances and applicable accounting framework under SFRS(I)9. The SC also reviews and recommends updates to the Governance &amp; Control Framework of ECL Model as well as the Impairment Allowance Policy at least on an annual basis. Any material changes to the ECL framework, methodology and policies are reviewed by SC before recommendation to the AC for concurrence and approval.

## Environmental Risk

Environmental risk issues, in particular climate change have become a major global challenge and urgently require a co-ordinated  global  response.  In  Singapore,  there  is  a  growing  momentum  to  build  a  financial  landscape  which is  conducive to achieve environmentally sustainable growth while contributing to the global efforts to transition to a low-carbon, climate resilience economy.

In  December 2020, the MAS issued a set of environmental risk management guidelines for the financial sector with the aim to enhance the sector's resilience to and management of environmental risk through the setting of sound risk management practices, including governance &amp; strategy and disclosure of environment risk information.

Financial  institutions  are  encouraged  to  integrate  environmental  risks  into  their  business  and  investment  decisions and disclose meaningful information that would enable its stakeholders to evaluate their performance in addressing environmental issues as a risk and an opportunity.

While  the  scale,  scope  and  business  models  of  financial  institutions  can  differ  vastly,  MAS  expects  approaches  to managing and disclosing environmental risk to mature as the methodologies for assessing, monitoring and reporting such risk evolve.

In  its  support  to  align  its  corporate  philosophy,  strategy  and  goals  to  the  government's  vision  of  green  finance,  the Company has in place a framework for its environmental risk management. The underlying structure of the framework will recognise that environmental risk poses potential financial and reputational impact to the Company in the form of:

- l Credit risk - adverse climate change can impair the value of assets held by our customers, or impact supply chains affecting our customers' operations and profitability, and potentially, their viability.
- l Market risk - the Company may be exposed to a decline in valuation and increased volatility in its investments, particularly to sectors which contribute to significant environmental degradation as a result of shifts in investor preferences.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

- l Liquidity risk - a surge in funds withdrawal and demand for emergency loans due to frequent natural disasters which can cause widespread damage to physical property and incur significant costs like constructions and repair costs. Environmentally-conscious depositors may also cut back on sources of funding if they perceive that the Company finance activities with a negative impact on the environment.
- l Operational risk - extreme weather events can disrupt business continuity by negatively impacting the Company's infrastructure, systems, processes and staff.
- l Reputational risk - negative perception of the Company can arise in financing customers that carry on business activities  which  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  environment,  affecting  the  Company's  ability  to  maintain  or establish business relationships.

## Market Risk

Market risk encompasses price and interest rate risk, which are inherent in the ordinary course of the Group's business. Market risk refers to the risk to the Group resulting from movements in market prices, in particular, changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity prices.

The Asset-Liability Committee ('ALCO') manages the balance sheet to achieve an optimal balance between risk and reward with regards to structural interest rate risk, and liquidity and funding risk. ALCO also oversees the investment portfolio of the Company, reviews and recommends the limits of the Company's investments for approval by RMC as well as approves policies and strategies regarding these investments.

The Group has a comprehensive set of policies and monitoring system in place for the management of market risk. This includes limits for funding, maturity, and re-pricing gaps between assets and liabilities. An additional measure used by the Group for the interest rate sensitive investments is Present Value of a Basis Point ('PV01'), which measures the change in value of the interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a parallel increase of one basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve.

The  Company's  investment  portfolio  mainly  consists  of  Singapore  Government  Securities  and  MAS  Bills  for  the maintenance of regulatory minimum liquid assets purposes.

The  Group  uses  an  Asset  Liability  Management  System  to  enhance  its  capabilities  for  balance  sheet  and  liquidity simulation; and scenario analysis. Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis can now be performed under various interest rate scenarios using simulation modelling.

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity  risk  refers  to  the  risk  of  the  Group  being  unable  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  as  they  fall  due  without incurring unacceptable costs or losses through fund raising and assets liquidation. It could be a result of the inability of  the  Group to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources and the failure to recognise or address changes in market conditions that affect the institution's ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. The Group maintains sufficient liquidity to fund its day-to-day operations, including customers' demands for loan drawdowns, as well as any unanticipated cash withdrawals.

The Group has a comprehensive monitoring system in place for the management of liquidity risk. This includes limits for funding &amp; liquidity gaps, deposit analysis and minimum liquid asset ratio.

Liquidity policies, procedures and limits are in place to ensure effective liquidity risk management and compliance with all regulatory requirements.

A robust liquidity stress test framework is in place to assess and plan for the impact of various scenarios which may put the Company's liquidity at risk.

The ALCO manages the liquidity and funding risk to determine the appropriate levels of liquidity and ensures that funding costs are managed effectively, and reviews stress tests &amp; contingency funding plans for liquidity crises situations.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Operational and Technology Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Technology risk is any risk related to information technology and information security.

The  Operational  and  Technology  Risk  Committee  ('OPTECH')  supports  the  RMC  in  its  handling  of  operational  and technology risk. The OPTECH recommends the operational and technology risk management framework, policies and procedures, and strategies to mitigate risks and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation risk processes and information flows.

To  pro-actively  manage  operational  risk,  each  department  undertakes  regular  operational  risk  and  control  selfassessments which involve identifying and assessing inherent risks, as well as assessing the effectiveness of controls to mitigate the identified risks. Where necessary, action plans are formulated based on the severity of the assessed residual risk after considering the mitigating controls. In addition, the Internal Audit function provides the assurance by conducting audits to assess the effectiveness of internal controls and report it to Management and the AC.

The  OPTECH  oversees  the  overall  outsourcing  function  for  the  Company  and  ensures  the  risk  management  of outsourcing arrangements is in compliance with MAS Guidelines on Outsourcing, especially for material outsourcing arrangements

All departments regularly review its own Business Impact Analysis and Disaster Recovery Plan and Management provides an attestation to the RMC on the state of readiness for the Company's business continuity management process, extent of alignment to MAS guidelines and declaration of residual risk.

Technology  risk  is  managed  in  accordance  with  a  Technology  Risk  Management  Framework  (which  covers  risk governance, identification, monitoring, assessment, mitigation and reporting), and supported by a set of information technology policies and standards, control processes and risk mitigation programs in alignment to MAS guidelines.

## Compliance risk

Compliance risk is the risk of impairment to the Group's ability to successfully conduct its business as a result of any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. The Compliance Department is responsible for the Group's satisfactory compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and internal policies, including applicable rules and policies on anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism.

The Compliance Department is an independent function within the organisation which provides support such as carrying out independent checks upon implementation of new or changes in policies and procedures, as well as providing advice on regulatory requirements to relevant departments.

## Internal controls

The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for the Group's system of internal controls.

The  external auditors carry out in the course of their statutory audit, a review of the effectiveness of the  material internal  controls  focusing  primarily  on  financial  controls,  to  the  extent  set  out  in  their  audit  plan.  Material non-compliance and internal control weaknesses noted during their audit, and the external auditors' recommendation to address such non-compliance and weaknesses, are reported to the AC. Management, with the assistance of the internal auditors, follows up on external auditors' recommendations as part of its role in the review of the  internal control systems.

Besides that, all business units perform self-assessment of their processes to evaluate and manage the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal controls, as well as their level of compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The results of the evaluations are reviewed by Management.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Written assurances on their adequacy and effectiveness (Provision 9.2)

The  Board  has  received  assurances  from  the  CEO,  the  Financial  Controller  ('FC'),  KMP  and  Heads  of  Department regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The Board has also received assurance from the CEO and the FC that as at 31 December 2023, the Group's financial records have been properly maintained, and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances.

Based on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by Management and various Board Committees and the assurances received from the CEO, FC, KMP and Heads of Department, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC and the RMC, is of the opinion that the Group's system of internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, and risk management systems were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2023 to address the risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations. No material weaknesses in the Company's internal controls and risk management systems were identified by the Board, the AC and the RMC in FY2023. Accordingly, the Company has complied with Listing Rule 1207(10).

The Board notes that the system of internal controls provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.

AC members are encouraged to attend seminars on updates to Financial Reporting Standards ('FRS'), when required.

In the review of the financial statements, the AC discussed with Management the accounting principles that were applied and their judgement of items that might affect the integrity of the financial statements. The AC also considered the clarity  of  disclosures on significant matters in the financial statements. Among other matters, the following key audit matters (KAMs) as reported by the external auditors for FY2023 on pages 74 to 75 were reviewed and discussed by the AC with Management and the external auditors:

| KAMs                                           | How the AC reviewed these matters and what decisions were made                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Independence of EA

Having reviewed the nature and extent of the non-audit services provided to the Group by KPMG LLP, the AC is of the opinion that the provision of such non-audit services did not affect the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. For details of the fees paid to the external auditors in respect of audit and non-audit services during FY2023, please refer to note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

The  AC  is  satisfied  that  the  external  auditors  has  the  requisite  expertise  and  resources  to  perform  their  duties. Accordingly, the AC has nominated KPMG LLP for re-appointment as the external auditors at the forthcoming AGM. KPMG LLP have confirmed that it is registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. The Company is  thus  in  compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of the Group's auditors.

## Internal Audit (Provision 10.4)

The Group has a well-established internal audit function with formal procedures for the internal auditors to report their audit findings directly to the AC.

The annual internal audit plan is prepared in consultation with, but independent of Management, and submitted to the AC for approval. The AC ensures that the internal audit function has appropriate standing within the Company. The internal auditors report directly to the AC on audit issues and the CEO on administrative matters. The findings and recommendations made by the internal auditors have been adequately followed through and implemented by Management in the financial year. The AC participates in and approves the hiring, removal, evaluation and compensation of  the  internal  audit  function.  The  internal  auditors  are  given  unfettered  access  to  all  company documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the AC.

Staffed by suitably qualified executives with relevant qualifications and experience, the primary role of the internal audit function is to assist the Board to evaluate the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls and risk management processes of the Company. The AC reviews the adequacy of the internal audit function through a review of  the  internal  auditor's  programmes on a quarterly basis and ensures that the internal audit function has adequate resources and appropriate authority to perform its functions properly. In doing so, the AC takes into consideration the service level, attentiveness, professionalism and calibre of the assigned personnel who carried out the internal audit activities during the financial year. The AC is also responsible for approving the appointment, remuneration, evaluation, resignation or dismissal of the Head of Internal Audit Department.

In  carrying out its function, our internal auditors are guided by the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by The Institute of Internal Auditors.

The  AC  has  appointed  Ernst  &amp;  Young  LLP  (Singapore)  to  perform  the  internal  audit  functions  for  the  Information Technology Services Department of the Group.

Based on its assessment, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the internal audit function was independent, effective and adequately resourced during FY2023.

The  Group  has  a  separate  compliance  function  to  help  ensure  adherence  with  applicable  legislation,  rules  and regulations in the conduct of its business.

## Meeting with external auditors and internal auditors (Provision 10.5)

The  AC  meets  with  the  external  and  internal  auditors  without  the  presence  of  Management  at  least  twice  during the  year.  The  AC  has  explicit  authority  to  investigate  any  matter  within  its  TOR,  full  access  to  and  co-operation  of Management and the internal auditors and has full discretion to invite any Director or executive officer to attend its meetings.  The auditors, both internal and external, have unrestricted access to the AC.

Both the internal auditors and external auditors have confirmed that they had access to and received full co-operation and assistance from Management and no restrictions were placed on the scope of their audit.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Whistleblowing Policy

The Company has in place a whistleblowing policy which sets out procedures that employees of the Group may raise in confidence, any concerns on suspected breach or fraud, or possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or behaviour that may not be in compliance with the law and Code of Conduct of the Company, without fear of reprisals. The whistleblowing policy is reviewed by the AC and approved by the Board annually to ensure that it remains current and relevant. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken.

The whistleblowing policy is accessible to all  employees via the Company's shared drive. Employees may report via the  dedicated  whistleblowing  communication channel to the AC Chairman. The Company has designated the AC to investigate whistleblowing reports made in good faith independently. The Company will treat all (written) complaints in  a  confidential and sensitive manner. A report of a complaint will only be disclosed to persons on a need to know basis  in  order  to  properly  carry  out  an  investigation  and  the  identity  of  the  whistleblower  is  kept  confidential.  The Company is committed to ensure protection of the whistleblower against detrimental or unfair treatment arising from whistleblowing. The AC is responsible for oversight and monitoring of whistleblowing.

There was no whistleblowing incident during FY2023.

| Allowance for ECL is viewed as a key audit matter as a result of the significance of the loans and advances to customers and inherent complexity in the Group's ECL model. The Group's loans and advances to customers represent 71% of its total assets. Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases: (i) 12-month ECLs for financial assets where credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk ('Stage 1 ECLs'); or (ii) Lifetime ECLs for financial assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition ('Stage 2 ECLs') or are credit impaired ('Stage 3 ECLs'). Judgement is required in the following areas including: l appropriateness of the methodology and parameters used in the ECL model; l identification of credit exposures which have exhibited a 'significant increase in credit risk' and l determination of relevant macroeconomic factors for incorporation into the economic scenario model. | We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the key controls in place over the credit approval and review processes. We performed sample checks of credit reviews on loans and advances to critically assess the appropriateness of the credit grading and any objective evidence of impairment. We also considered the appropriateness of the criteria designed by management to identify significant increase in credit risk. For credit impaired exposures, we assessed the reasonableness of management estimates of expected future cashflows, including the realisable value of collaterals if relevant. For non-credit impaired exposures, we reviewed the appropriateness of the ECL methodology and management's assumptions on the key parameters used in the ECL model, including their regression analysis on the relevance of the economic factors to their economic scenario model. We also tested the accuracy of key data inputs into the ECL models for a sample of exposures as at year-end by verifying them against source systems and documents. We independently re-calculated the ECL allowance for a sample of credit exposures to test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations produced by the ECL model. In addition, we considered the adequacy of disclosures of these key assumptions in the financial statements. Based on our procedures performed, the methodology and assumptions adopted by management in the ECL model are acceptable and the ECL computation is consistent with the ECL model. |

## Other information

Management is responsible for the other information contained in the annual report.  Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.

We have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report except for the analysis of shareholding ('the Report'), which is expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In  connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If,  based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

## Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient  to  provide  a  reasonable  assurance  that  assets  are  safeguarded  against  loss  from  unauthorised  use  or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditors'  report  that  includes  our  opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.  We also:

- l Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
- l Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (Continued)

- l Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- l Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our  auditors'  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- l Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- l Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business activities  within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless the law or regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Tan Chun Wei (Chen Junwei).

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

These notes form an integral part of the financial statements.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 28 February 2024.

## 1. Domicile and activities

Singapura Finance Ltd ('the Company') is incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and has its registered office at 150 Cecil Street, #01-00, Singapore 069543.

The principal activities of the Company are those relating to finance companies operating under the Finance Companies Act 1967.  The principal activities of the subsidiaries are set out in note 9 to the financial statements.

The financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group' and individually as 'Group entities').

## 2. Basis of preparation

## 2.1 Statement of compliance

The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Singapore  Financial  Reporting  Standards (International) ('SFRS(I)').

## 2.2 Basis of measurement

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities which are measured at fair values.

## 2.3 Functional and presentation currency

These financial  statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the Group's functional currency.  All financial  information  presented  in  Singapore  dollars  have  been  rounded  to  the  nearest  thousand,  unless otherwise stated.

## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is included in note 3.4 Impairment.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 2. Basis of preparation (Continued)

## 2.5 Changes in accounting policies

## New standards and amendments

The Group has applied the following SFRS(I)s, amendments to and interpretations of SFRS(I) for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2023:

- l SFRS(I) 17 Insurance contracts
- l Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies
- l Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-8: Definition of Accounting Estimates
- l Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single transaction
- l Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12: International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules

Other than the below, the application of these amendments to standards and interpretations does not have a material effect on the financial statements.

## Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction

The Group has adopted Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction from 1 January 2023. The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption to exclude transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.

For leases, an entity is required to recognise the associated deferred tax assets and liabilities from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with any cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity at that date. For all other transactions, an entity applies the amendments to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented.

The Group previously accounted for deferred tax on leases by applying the 'integrally linked' approach, resulting in a similar outcome as under the amendments, except that the deferred tax asset or liability was recognised on a net basis. Following the amendments, the Group has recognised a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability in relation to its right-of-use assets. However, there was no impact on the statement of financial position because the balances qualify for offset under paragraph 74 of SFRS(I) 1-12. There was also no impact on the opening retained earnings as at 1 January 2022 as a result of the change.

## Material accounting policy information

The Group adopted Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies for the first time in 2023. Although the amendments did not result in any changes to the accounting policies themselves, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial statements.

The  amendments  require  the  disclosure  of  'material',  rather  than  'significant',  accounting  policies.  The amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality to disclosure of accounting policies, assisting entities  to  provide  useful,  entity-  specific  accounting  policy  information  that  users  need  to  understand  other information in the financial statements.

The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements by Group entities, except as explained above which addresses changes in material accounting policies.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, which addresses changes in accounting policies.

## 3.1 Basis of consolidation

## (i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity, when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.

## (ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

- (iii) Loss of control

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

## (iv) Accounting for subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company's balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

## 3.2 Property, plant and equipment

## (i) Recognition and measurement

Items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and accumulated impairment losses.  Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

Cost  includes  expenditure  that  is  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  of  the  asset.  The  cost  of self-constructed assets includes:

- l the cost of materials and direct labour;
- l any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use;
- l when the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located; and
- l capitalised borrowing costs.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

If  significant  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  have  different  useful  lives,  they  are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.2 Property, plant and equipment (Continued)

## (i) Recognition and measurement (Continued)

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.

## (ii) Subsequent costs

The  cost  of  replacing  a  component  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  recognised  in  the carrying  amount  of  the  item  if  it  is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefits  embodied  within  the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably.  The carrying amount of the replaced  component  is  derecognised.    The  costs  of  the  day-to-day  servicing  of  property,  plant  and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.

## (iii) Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value.  Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment, unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.  Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:

Freehold land and buildings -

40 years

Leasehold land and buildings -

Lease period or useful lives, whichever is shorter

Furniture and office equipment -

Between 5 and 8 years

Motor vehicles -

4 years

Computers -

Between 3 and 5 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

## 3.3 Financial instruments

## (i) Recognition and initial measurement

## Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities

The Group initially  recognises  loans  and  receivables  and  deposits  when  they  are  originated.    All  other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

## Non-derivative financial assets

## Classification

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') - debt investments; FVOCI - equity investments; or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL').

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.

## Financial assets at amortised cost

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- l it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- l its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## Debt investments at FVOCI

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- l it  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- l its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## Equity investments at FVOCI

On  initial  recognition  of  an  equity  investment  that  is  not  held-for-trading,  the  Group  may  irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI.  This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

## Financial assets at FVTPL

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the  requirements to  be  measured at  amortised  cost  or  at  FVOCI  as  at  FVTPL  if  doing  so  eliminates  or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses (Continued)

## Business model assessment

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management.  The information considered includes:

- l the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These  include  whether  management's  strategy  focuses  on  earning  contractual  interest  income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- l how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;
- l the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed;
- l how managers of the business are compensated - e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and
- l the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.

## Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition.    'Interest'  is  defined  as  consideration  for  the  time  value  of  money  and  for  the  credit  risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

In  assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument.  This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.  In making this assessment, the Group considers:

- l contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;
- l terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;
- l prepayment and extension features; and
- l terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses (Continued)

## Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (Continued)

A  prepayment  feature  is  consistent  with  the  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  criterion  if  the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally,  for  a  financial  asset  acquired  at  a  significant  discount  or  premium  to  its  contractual  par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

## Subsequent measurement and gains and losses

## Financial assets at amortised cost

These  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.    The amortised  cost  is  reduced  by  impairment  losses.    Interest  income,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.  Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

## Debt investments at FVOCI

These  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.  Interest  income  calculated  using  the  effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.  Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI.  On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.

## Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value.  Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.  Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

## Financial assets at FVTPL

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value.  Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.

## Non-derivative financial liabilities

## Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

## (iii) Derecognition

## Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset  expire,  or  it  transfers  the  rights  to  receive  the  contractual  cash  flows  in  a  transaction  in  which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.

Any cumulative gain or loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

## Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.

## (iv) Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## (v) Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

## 3.4 Impairment

## Non-derivative financial assets

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses ('ECLs') on:

- l financial assets measured at amortised costs; and
- l debt investments measured at FVOCI.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.4 Impairment (Continued)

Non-derivative financial assets (Continued)

Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases:

- l 12-month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months); or
- l Lifetime  ECLs:  these  are  ECLs  that  result  from  all  possible  default  events  over  the  expected  life  of  a financial instrument.

## General approach

The Group applies the general approach to provide for ECLs on all financial instruments.  Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs at initial recognition.

At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  assesses  whether  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  instrument  has  increased significantly since initial recognition.  When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.  This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based  on  the  Group's  historical  experience  and  informed  credit  assessment  and  includes  forward-looking information.

If  credit  risk  has  not  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition  or  if  the  credit  quality  of  the  financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- l the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or
- l the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

The Group considers a financial guarantee to be in default when the debtor of the loan is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the creditor and the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held).  The Group only applies a discount rate if, and to the extent that, the risks are not taken into account by adjusting the expected cash shortfalls.

The Group considers Singapore Government securities and bank deposits to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is equivalent to 'investment grade' assigned by internationally recognised external credit rating agencies.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.

## Measurement of ECLs

ECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses.  Credit losses are measured at the present value of all  cash  shortfalls  (i.e.  the  difference  between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive).  ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.4 Impairment (Continued)

Non-derivative financial assets (Continued)

## Credit-impaired financial assets

At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  assesses  whether  financial  assets  carried  at  amortised  cost  and  debt investments at FVOCI are credit-impaired.  A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- l significant financial difficulty of the borrower;
- l a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;
- l the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
- l it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- l the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

## Presentation of allowance for ECLs in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.

For debt investments at FVOCI, loss allowances are charged to profit or loss and recognised in OCI.

Loss allowances for financial guarantee are recognised as a financial liability to the extent that they exceed the initial carrying amount of the financial guarantee less the cumulated income recognised.

## Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.  This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off.  However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for   of amounts due.

## 3.5 Provisions

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation.    Provisions  are  determined  by  discounting  the  expected  future  cash  flows  at  a  pre-tax  rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.

## 3.6 Interest

Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.  The effective interest  rate  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  the  estimated  future  cash  payments  and  receipts  through  the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability (or,  where appropriate, a shorter period) to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortised cost of the financial liability.  The effective interest rate is  established on initial recognition of the financial assets and is not revised subsequently unless contractually adjusted.

## 3.6 Interest (Continued)

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.  Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.

Interest income and expense presented in the income statement include interest on financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost on an effective interest rate basis.

Where charges are added to the principal financed at the commencement of the period, the general principle adopted for crediting income to profit or loss is to spread the income over the period in which the repayments are due using the following bases for the various categories of financing business:

## Interest income on loans and advances

In general, the basis adopted for crediting income from loans to profit or loss is to spread the interest over the period in which the repayments are due.  Interest on mortgage loans is charged on the annual/monthly/daily rest basis and credited to profit or loss in the period to which it relates.

## Interest rebate on hire purchase

Term charges on hire purchase and leasing transactions are accounted for using the Rule of 78 (sum of digits) method.  The balance of such term charges at the financial year end is carried forward as unearned charges.

## Interest income from Singapore Government Securities

Interest  income from Singapore Government Securities is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.

## Interest income from bank deposits

Interest income from bank deposits is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.

## 3.7 Tax

Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.  Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets .

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Deferred tax is  recognised  in  respect  of  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  amounts  used  for  taxation  purposes.    Deferred  tax  is  not recognised for temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 3 Material accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.7 Tax (Continued)

The  measurement  of  deferred  taxes  reflects  the  tax  consequences  that  would  follow  the  manner  in  which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  unused  tax  losses,  unused  tax  credits  and  deductible  temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

## 3.8 Earnings per share

The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares.  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weightedaverage number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.  Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weightedaverage number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

## Extension options

Some property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to  provide  operational  flexibility.  The  extension  options  held  are  exercisable  only  by  the  Group  and  not  by the lessors. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2023

## 23 Financial risk management

## Overview

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

- l credit risk
- l liquidity risk
- l market risk

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital.

## Risk management framework

The  Board  of  Directors  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  establishment  and  oversight  of  the  Group's  risk management  framework.    The  Board  has  established  the  Risk  Management  Committee  ('RMC'),  which  is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies.  The RMC reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.

The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risk and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.  All major policy decisions and approval on risk exposures including loan limits are approved by the Board of Directors upon concurrence by the RMC.  In addition, internal audits are conducted on an on-going basis to confirm that these policies and procedures are functioning effectively and any deviations are duly highlighted for special attention.

## Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's loans and advances to customers.  For risk management reporting purposes, the Group considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure.

## Management of credit risk

The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of credit risk to the RMC, which in turn appoints the Credit Control Committee and Credit Portfolio Committee to assist in the management of credit risk.  The  Credit Control Committee develops the credit risk management framework, policies and procedures for review and concurrence by RMC and approval by the Board of Directors. The Credit Control Committee also reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions.

Credit reviews are conducted regularly to monitor the health of the loan portfolio and to detect early signs of weaknesses and deviations.

The Credit Portfolio Committee manages risk on a portfolio-wide basis and recommends alternative portfolio strategies,  analyses  results  of  portfolio  management  actions,  and  develops  portfolio  limits  for  each  portfolio segment for approval by the RMC.  Credit risk concentration is addressed by setting a credit portfolio mix limit and monitoring the  limit  on  a  regular  basis.  The  Credit  Portfolio  Committee  periodically  reviews  the  lending authority framework, portfolio concentration limits and credit stress test framework.

## Management of credit risk (Continued)

Credit stress tests are also conducted periodically to determine the impact of security values and other stress parameters on the loan portfolio.  This allows the Group to assess the potential financial impact of losses arising from plausible adverse scenarios on the Group's loan portfolio.

The SFRS(I) 9 Committee ('SC') works closely with Credit Portfolio Committee and Credit Control Committee to ensure that the Group has appropriate credit risk practices, including an effective system of internal control, to consistently  determine  adequate allowances in accordance with the Group's policies and procedures relating to  impairment  allowances  and  applicable  accounting  framework  under  SFRS(I)  9.  The  SC  also  reviews  and recommends updates to the Governance &amp; Control Framework of ECL Model as well as the Impairment Allowance Policy.  Any  material  changes  to  the  ECL  framework,  methodology  and  policies  are  reviewed  by  SC  before recommendation to the Audit Committee for concurrence and approval.

## Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment

## Assessment of significant increase in credit risk

When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.  This  includes  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  information  and  analysis,  based  on  the Group's historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Group considers significant increase in credit risk occurs when an asset is more than 30 days past due.

## Modified financial assets

The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value.

## Calculation of expected credit losses

Expected credit losses are calculated using three main components

- l probability of default ('PD');
- l loss given default ('LGD'); and
- l exposure at default ('EAD').

These components are generally derived from internally developed statistical models using historical, current and forward-looking macro-economic data such as GDP, interest rate, unemployment and inflation. These factors are reviewed regularly.

## 23 Financial risk management (Continued)

## Credit risk (Continued)

## Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment (Continued)

## Calculation of expected credit losses (Continued)

## Probability of default

The 12-month and lifetime PD represent the expected point-in-time probability of a default over the next 12 months and remaining lifetime of the financial  instrument,  respectively,  based  on  conditions  existing  at  the balance sheet date and future economic conditions that affect credit risk.

The PD is derived using Delinquency Roll Rate Model which incorporates historical default rates over past years, adjusted for forward-looking information and reflecting current portfolio composition and market data such as growth in GDP, unemployment and inflation.

## Loss given default

LGD represents expected loss conditional on default, taking into account the mitigating effect of collateral, its expected value when realised and the time value of money.

## Exposure at default

EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure  to  the  counterparty  and  potential  changes  to  the  current  amount  allowed  under  the  contract  and arising from amortisation. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations.

The 12-month ECL is equal to the discounted sum over the next 12 months of monthly PD multiplied by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the discounted sum of monthly PD over the full remaining life multiplied by LGD and EAD.

## Macro-economic variable adjustment

The  Macro-economic  variable  adjustment  ('MVA')is  sensitive  to  judgments  and  assumptions  made  regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how such scenarios are incorporated in the calculations.

The Group has internal governance frameworks and controls in place to assess the appropriateness of MVA. The aim of the Group is to incorporate these MVA into the ECL models, where possible, as part of the periodic recalibration and model assessment procedures.

## Exposure to credit risk

The  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  is  represented  by  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  assets  in  the statements of financial position, reduced by the value of the collateral held.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for loans and advances:

Past due but not impaired :  when contractual interest or principal payments are past due by not more than three months and the Group believes that impairment is not appropriate on the basis of the security available and/or the stage of collection.

Write  off :  The  Group  writes  off  wholly  or  partially  loan  balances  (together  with  any  related  allowances  for impairment losses) when the Group determines that the debts are irrecoverable, e.g. borrower has been made bankrupt, or all actions have been exhausted.

The Group normally holds collateral against loans and advances to customers.  These are in the form of mortgage interests  over  property  and  ownership  or  other  registered  interests  over  assets.    Estimates  of  fair  value  of collateral are assessed in each accounting period prior to determination of individual impairment allowances.

The financial effect of collateral and other security enhancements held against loans and advances to customers is shown below:

## Debt investments

The Group and the Company held Singapore Government securities of $203,911,000 as at 31 December 2023 (2022: $191,527,000).  The credit rating of Singapore Government Securities held at the reporting date accorded by various international credit rating agencies is AAA (2022: AAA).  The Group considers that its debt investments have  low  credit  risk  based  on  the  external  credit  ratings  of  the  counterparties.  Hence,  the  amount  of  the allowance on debt investments is negligible.

## Cash and balances with banks

The Group and the Company held cash and balances with banks of $99,447,000 and $99,432,000 respectively as at 31 December 2023 (2022: $100,260,000 and $100,243,000).  The cash and balances with banks are mainly held with bank and financial institution counterparties which are rated BBB+ to AA, based on various international credit ratings.

Loss allowance on cash and balances with banks has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures.  The Group considers that its cash and balances with banks have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.

The Group uses a similar approach for assessment of ECLs for cash and balances with banks to those used for loans and advances. The amount of the allowance on cash and balances with banks is negligible.

## Statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore

The Group and the Company held statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore of $22,019,000 as at 31 December 2023 (2022: $23,445,000) which is rated AAA, based on various international credit ratings. Hence, the Group considers that its statutory deposits have low credit risk and the amount of allowance is negligible.

## Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.

## Management of liquidity risk

The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions,  without  incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.

The Group is currently funded from equity and deposit liabilities.  Liquidity risk arises from the management of the net funding position after accounting for the ongoing cash flows from the loan assets, the deposit liabilities and the interest-bearing placements at various points in time.

Liquidity risk is managed in accordance to the Group's liquidity framework of policies, contingency funding plan, controls and limits approved by the Asset and Liability Committee ('ALCO').  This framework ensures that liquidity risk is  monitored and managed in a manner that ensures sufficient sources of funds are available over a range of market conditions.  Stress testing is conducted under the Group/Company-specific crisis and general market crisis scenarios.  This is undertaken to assess and plan for the impact of the scenarios which may put the Group's liquidity at risk.

Liquidity risk is also mitigated through the large number of customers in its diverse loans and deposits bases and the close monitoring of exposure to avoid any undue concentration.

## Maturity analysis of financial liabilities

The following are the contractual maturities of the Group's and Company's non-derivatives financial liabilities, loan commitments and contingent liabilities at the reporting date, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows (including interest payments) at the earliest date the Group and Company can be required to pay.

The expected cash flows on these instruments may vary significantly from this analysis.  In particular, deposits from customers are expected to maintain a stable balance; and undrawn loan commitments are not all available to be drawn down immediately upon finalisation of legal documentation due to factors like the progressive nature of the facility to be based on the stage of completion of work in progress.

## 23 Financial risk management (Continued)

## Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.  The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

## Currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of financial assets or liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  The Group is not exposed to foreign currency risk.

## Interest rate risk

Interest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  value  of  the  Group's  financial  assets  and/or  financial  liabilities  changes because of changes in interest rates.  Interest rate risk arises primarily from the fact that financial assets and financial liabilities typically reprice at different points in time.

## Risk management policy

The overall objective of interest rate risk management is to manage current and future earnings sensitivity arising from various interest rate exposures.  Interest rate risk exposures are measured using a combination of repricing gap, present value of 1 basis point reports and simulation modelling.  The ALCO recommends policies, ratios and limits for review and concurrence by RMC and approval by the Board of Directors. The RMC assists the Board in ensuring the effective management of market risks. The ALCO meets periodically to review the risk profile of the Group against the prevailing business and economic conditions, focusing on market and interest rate risks.  The ALCO also relates the structure of assets and liabilities to funding mismatches and interest rate repricing risks and ensure compliance with the approved policies and risk exposures (including ratios and limits).

## Exposure to interest rate risk

The Group does not hold a trading portfolio.  The principal risk to which its non-trading portfolio is exposed arises from the risk of fluctuations in the future cash flows or fair values of financial instruments because of changes in  market interest rates.  Interest rate risk is managed principally through monitoring interest rate gaps and by having pre-approved limits for repricing bands.

The Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group's loan and investment portfolios as well as deposit liabilities.  Interest rate risk will arise when these assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times or in differing amounts, or when market conditions dictate the extent of repricing possible.  The Group manages this risk through diversity in its loan portfolio and to a lesser extent in its deposit portfolio.

## Sensitivity analysis

## Interest rate risk

Interest rate sensitivity analyses are performed under various interest rate scenarios using simulation modelling where the sensitivity of projected net interest income is measured against changes in market interest rates.

The projected impact on future net interest income before tax over the next twelve months from the close of the year is simulated under various interest rate assumptions.  Based on a 100 basis point parallel rise in yield curves applied to the reporting date position, net interest income is estimated to increase by $2,614,000 (2022: increase by $2,675,000).  The corresponding impact from a 100 basis point fall is an estimated reduction of $2,613,000 (2022: $2,674,000) in net interest income.

The sensitivity analysis of the Group is illustrative only.  It assumes that interest rates of all tenors move by the same amount and does not reflect the potential impact on net interest income of some rates changing while others remained unchanged.  The analysis also assumes that all financial assets and liabilities run to contractual maturity without action by the Group to mitigate any impact of such changes.

## Portfolio price risk

Portfolio price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to the individual security or factors that affect all instruments in the market.

At  the  reporting  date,  the  Group  has  FVOCI-debt  instruments  on  Singapore  Government  Securities  of approximately  $204  million  (2022:  $192  million).    A  1%  increase  in  prices  at  the  reporting  date  would  have increased  equity  by  $2.0  million  (2022:  $1.9  million).    An  equal  change  in  the  opposite  direction  would  have decreased equity by $2.0 million (2022: $1.9 million).  The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2022.

The sensitivity analysis is based on management's best estimate of the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change. In practice, the actual results will differ from the sensitivity analysis and the differences could be material.

## Capital management

## Regulatory capital

The Group maintains a capital adequacy ratio ('CAR') in excess of the prescribed ratio, which is expressed as a percentage of adjusted regulatory capital to total risk weighted assets.

- (1) The Group's adjusted regulatory capital includes share capital, capital reserve, statutory reserve, general reserve,  fair  value  reserve  relating  to  unrealised  losses  on  equity  securities  classified  as  FVOCI  and accumulated profits.

The fair value reserve relating to unrealised gains/losses on Singapore Government Securities classified as FVOCI-debt instruments and unrealised gains on equity securities classified as FVOCI-equity instruments are excluded from the Group's adjusted regulatory capital.

- (2) Risk-weighted assets are determined according to specified requirements by the Monetary Authority of Singapore that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to assets and off-balance sheet exposures.

The Group's regulatory capital position as at 31 December was as follows:

|                        | 2023 $'000   | 2022 $'000   |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Share capital          | 168,896      | 168,896      |

## 24 Fair values of financial instruments

In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and make assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.

Although management have employed their best judgement in the estimation of fair values, there is inevitably a significant element of subjectivity involved in the calculations.  Therefore, the fair value estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Group could have realised in a sales transaction at the reporting date.

The  methodologies  and  assumptions  used  depend  on  the  terms  and  risk  characteristics  of  the  various instruments and include the following:

## Financial instruments for which fair value approximates the carrying amount

The carrying values of statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, other receivables and deposits, cash and balances with banks and trade and other payables, approximate their fair values as these balances are short-term in nature or are receivable or payable on demand.

## Investment in Singapore Government Securities

The fair values of FVOCI-debt instruments are determined by reference to their quoted closing bid prices at the reporting date.

## Loans and advances

The fair value of loans and advances that mature or reprice within six months of the reporting date is assumed to equate to the carrying value.  The fair value of all other loans and advances was calculated using discounted cash flow models based on the maturity of the loans. The discount rates applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of loans.

## Deposits and savings accounts of customers

The  fair  value  of  deposits  and  savings  accounts  of  customers  which  mature  or  reprice  within  six  months  is estimated to be the carrying value at the reporting date.  The fair value of other term deposits was calculated using  discounted  cash  flow  models,  based  on  the  deposit  type  and  its  related  maturity.    The  discount  rates applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of deposits.

## Borrowings from MAS

The carrying value of the borrowings from MAS approximates its fair values.

## Fair value hierarchy

The table below analyses fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities, by the levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques.  The different levels are defined as follows:

- l Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date.
- l Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
- l Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
