## PERFORMANCE REVIEW

The operating environment for FY2021  continued  to  be  challenging due  to  COVID-19.  Nonetheless,  the improvement of 101.8% compared to the same period last year. The stronger performance was primarily attributed to  higher  net  interest  income  and hiring  charges  and  lower  impairment allowances on loans.

Net interest income and hiring charges rose by 34.6% to $24.6 million  compared  to  $18.3  million  in the  previous  corresponding  period. This  was  mainly  attributable  to  the decline  in  interest  expenses  by  $8.1 million driven by lower deposit rates.  Non-interest  income  declined by  $1.0  million  mainly  due  to  lower Government  Covid-19 grants. Total operating expenses increased by 3.9% compared  to  same  period  last  year mainly due to higher other operating Group  continued  to  invest  in  digital transformation.

There was a net charge for loan impairment losses amounting to

$1.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2021 compared to $2.3 million  during  the  same  period  last year.  This  was  mainly  attributed  to additional  allowances  for  not  creditimpaired  loans  with  the  uncertainty in  the  current  COVID-19  pandemic environment. With the higher allowances for not credit-impaired loans, $1.3 million was released from Regulatory Loss Allowance Reserve to in Equity. The Group continues to set aside adequate allowances in respect of its loan portfolio.

The Group's shareholders' funds remains  robust  at  $256  million  as  at 31 December 2021, and is more than the current economic slowdown. Our capital adequacy ratio continues to be well  above  the  regulatory  minimum requirement.

Fair value reserve for the year ended 31  December  2021  declined  by  $5.5 million. This is mainly due to decrease in  the  fair  value  of  the  Singapore Government Securities (SGS). The Group purchases SGS for the purposes of maintaining minimum liquid assets as required under the Finance Companies Act.

The Group's total loan, net of allowances, increased by 6.9% to $896 million as at 31 December 2021 compared to $838 million as at

31 December  2020.  Total deposits remained largely unchanged at about $908 million as at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020.

In  the  opinion  of  the  Directors,  no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen which is of  the  operations  of  the  Group  and the Company in the interval between date of this report.

## DIVIDENDS

Subject  to  approval  of  shareholders at  the  forthcoming  Annual  General Meeting, the Board is recommending dividend of 2.0 cents per share and a special  one-tier  tax  exempt  dividend of  2.0  cents  per  share  for  FY2021.

## OUTLOOK

The Singapore economy grew by 6.1% a  year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2021, moderating from the 7.5% growth in the previous quarter. On  a  quarter-on-quarter  seasonallyadjusted basis, the economy expanded

by  2.3%  in  the  fourth  quarter,  faster than the 1.5% growth in the preceding quarter.  For  the  whole  of  2021,  the economy  grew  by  7.6%,  rebounding from the 4.1% contraction in 2020.

Domestically, our high vaccination rate and steady rollout of booster shots will continue  to  facilitate  the  progressive easing of domestic and border restrictions, which  will  support  the recovery  of  consumer-facing  sectors and alleviate  labour  shortages  in  the engineering sectors, and support their recovery  sectors  that  are  reliant  on migrant workers. Air travel and visitor arrivals are also expected to improve with the loosening of travel restrictions and  expansion  of  Vaccinated  Travel Lanes ('VTL').

The  global  economy  has  performed broadly in line with expectations. Advanced economies which have achieved  high  vaccination  rates  and also  started  booster  shots,  such  as the US and key Eurozone economies, have largely removed restriction measures  even  amidst  the spread of the highly-infectious Delta and Omicron variants. This  has  helped to sustain their economic recoveries. By contrast, COVID-19 outbreaks and  the  re-imposition  of  restrictions had  disrupted  the  recoveries  of  key Southeast Asian economies, although some  of  these  restrictions  are  being gradually lifted as their respective domestic health situations stabilise.

Looking ahead, the recovery of various sectors in 2022 is expected to remain uneven. Authorities expect more economic  activity  to  resume  globally in  2022  barring  the  materialisation

of downside risks arising from the  evolution  of  the  virus  or  other global  developments  such  as  China's economic  slowdown  and  protracted global supply chain disruptions. However,  the  Government  has  also warned  of  supply  chain  disruption and  rising  energy  commodity  prices, result  in  an  earlier  or  larger  increase in interest rates than anticipated, and may trigger a tightening of global

Amid  an  uneven  recovery  at  home and lingering  uncertainty  over  global growth, Singapore's economic growth is  expected  to  slow  to  between  3% and  5%  in  2022.  We  are  cautiously optimistic  of  our  domestic  operating environment  for  2022  with  our  high vaccination rates. The Group will continue to forge ahead, paying close  attention  to  commercial  risks and positioning  for  growth  when  the economic  rebound  and  consumers post-COVID-19 recovery.

## ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE

For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group recorded of  101.8%  as  compared to  the  same  period  last  year.  The stronger performance was primarily attributed to higher net interest  income  and  hiring  charges  and  lower  impairment allowances on loans.

Net  interest  income  and  hiring  charges  rose  by  34.6%  to $24.6  million  compared  to  $18.3  million  in  the  previous corresponding period. This was  mainly attributable to the  decline  in  interest  expenses  by  $8.1  million  driven  by lower  deposit  rates.  Non-interest  income  declined  by  $1.0 million  mainly  due  to  lower  Government  Covid-19  grants. Total  operating  expenses  increased  by  3.9%  compared  to same period last year mainly due to higher other operating digital transformation.

There was a net charge for loan impairment losses amounting to $1.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2021 compared to $2.3 million during the same period last year. This was mainly attributed to additional allowances for not credit-impaired loans with the uncertainty in the current COVID-19 pandemic environment. With the higher allowances for not credit-impaired loans, $1.3 million was released from Equity. The Group continues to set aside adequate allowances in respect of its loan portfolio.

The  Group's  shareholders'  funds  remains  robust  at  $256 million as at 31 December 2021, and is more than adequate Our capital  adequacy ratio  continues  to  be  well  above  the regulatory minimum requirement.

Fair  value  reserve  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2021 declined by  $5.5  million.  This  is  mainly  due  to  decrease  in the fair value of the Singapore Government Securities (SGS). The Group purchases SGS for the purposes of maintaining minimum  liquid  assets  as  required  under  the  Finance Companies Act.

The Group's total loan, net of allowances, increased by 6.9% to $896 million as at 31 December 2021 compared to $838

year  ended  31  December  2021  compared  to  the  same period last year mainly due to drop in cost of funds.

Total interest income decreased by $1.8m or 5.8% mainly attributed to the drop  in  interest  income  from  bank deposits  and loans  and  advances  amidst  the  low  interest rate environment.

Correspondingly, total interest expense dropped sharply by $8.1m or 61.8% as the cost of funds decreased sharply from 1.42% to 0.55% during the year.

As the rate of drop in assets yield is lower than that of cost of funds, the Group's net interest margin as a percentage of the interest-earning assets increased from 1.57% to 2.16%.

In line with Singapore's Climate Action Plan to build a 'ClimateResilient Singapore, for a Sustainable Future' 11 , SFL strives to continue contributing to this movement by reducing our own environmental and carbon footprint.

To do so, we have implemented policies and procedures to manage our energy use such as educating our employees and engaging them in matters concerning energy consumption. As part of our 'Go Green' initiative, we have communicated green information periodically using both formal and informal communication tools to encourage our employees employees  to  switch  to  sleep  mode  on  their  electronic they are not in use. Furthermore, we monitor our electricity bills diligently  to  identify and  address any abnormal usage as  well  as  rectify  any  equipment  malfunctioning.  Since we continue to encourage our  employees to adopt better recycling habits.

Electricity usage is our main source of energy consumption. In FY2021, we achieved the target set in FY2020 which was to convert current lighting to LED lighting. We have completed the transformation of current lighting to LED lighting for Ang Mo Kio Customer Centre, Woodlands Customer Centre and HO Banking Hall.  Going forward, we will continue our goal to convert current lighting to LED lighting and improve our energy consumption (kWh) and energy intensity by number of employees (kWh/employees).

## GOVERNANCE

## Socioeconomic Compliance

[GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 419-1]

In  order  to  maintain  the  trust  of  our  stakeholders,  we understand  that  it  is  important  to  be  compliant  with  the relevant laws and regulations. Hence, we are committed to ensure that we conduct our business with utmost integrity and high standards of business ethics. This is in line with our core values.

To do so, our compliance department will take steps to assess the implications of any updates of regulations and report to Operational &amp; Technology Risk Committee ('OPTECH') every 2  months  and  HODs  quarterly.  They  are  also  responsible for  communicating new regulations  or changes  to existing regulations  to  the  relevant  HODs  within  3  working  days. Assessment ('RRSA') checklist. To stay relevant, SFL ensures that our compliance department receives email alerts from MAS  and  other  regulatory  bodies  for  latest  updates  and disseminate the information to relevant departments within 3 working days.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

Next,  we  have  in  place  a  Compliance  Risk  Management Framework. It consists of the objective for the management of  compliance  risk,  governance  and  oversight  structure, roles  and  responsibilities  as  well  as  the  compliance  risk management process. The purpose of this framework is to serve  as  a  guide  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  Management, Compliance Department and all employees on the key areas to note when dealing with compliance risks.

We then perform a quarterly review of scripless shareholders to monitor any non-disclosure of shareholding or transactions by  our  employees.  An  internal  guideline  is  in  place,  which during the period commencing one month before the date an  Enterprise-Wide  Risk  Assessment  ('EWRA')  for  AML  is conducted annually.

We  have  successfully  achieved  our  targeted  performance sanctions for non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations  in  the  social  and  economic  area.  We  are  also pleased  to  announce  that  100%  of  our  employees  were proactive in attending trainings related to compliance, AML and CFT. We aim to maintain this good performance and to ensure that all employees attend compliance trainings in the following year.

## Anti-corruption

[GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 205-2, GRI 205-3]

Corruption is a considerable obstacle to economic and social development of the Company and at SFL, we do not tolerate any forms of corruption. As a form of deterrence, we have taken  the  initiative  to  put  in  place  several  anti-corruption policies available on the Company's general online drive for Policy,  Fraud  Policy,  Interested  Party  Transactions  ('IPT') Policy,  Related  Party  Transactions  ('RPT')  Policy  as  well  as Policy  and  Guidelines  on  AML  and  CFT.  These  policies  are reviewed regularly to ensure they are always up to date.

It  is  compulsory  for  new  joiners  to  attend  an  Anti-Money Laundering  and  Countering  the  Financing of  Terrorism ('AML/CFT') training within 6 months of joining the Company. New  joiners  are  also  required  to  read  and  familiarise  themselves with the Fraud, Whistleblowing, Related Party and Interested party  policies  of  the  Company.  In  2021,  a  total  number  of 102 employees (100% of eligible employees 18  ) attended our AML/CFT training.

SFL  also  engages  an  external  consultant  every  2  years SFL provides an alternative channel for whistle blowers to lodge  a  report  of  improper  conduct  in  the  Company  on implementing  and  managing  whistle  blower  protection programme.

In  2021,  we  have  achieved  our  goal  of  zero  incidents  of corruption, fraud,  whistle  blowing,  improper  interested party transactions or related party transactions, anti-money resulted in legal action,  and we aim to continue achieving this  goal  in  2022.  There  were  also  no  incidents  in  which employees  were  dismissed  or  disciplined  for  corruption and zero incidents when contracts with  business partners were terminated or not renewed due to violations related to  corruption.  In  addition,  we  were  not  faced  with  any public legal cases regarding corruption brought against the Company  or  our  employees  during  the  reporting  period. SFL  maintained  zero  tolerance  for  knowingly  breaching regulations  on  anti-money  laundering  and  countering  the the necessary enhanced due diligence measures.

We  plan  to  maintain  the  100%  attendance  rate  in  anticorruption  related  trainings  for  eligible  employees  as  well as  creating  awareness  on  the  repercussions  of  corruption through  our  regular  review  and  enhancement  of  anticorruption policies

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

With the demise of Mr Phua Bah Lee on 26 December 2021, the Board comprised eight  Directors, all of whom, except for the Executive Chairman and the CEO, are non-executive and independent Directors. The six independent Directors were Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang. The Company has no alternate directors on its Board.

Independent Directors make up the majority of the Board.  Every year, the NC determines the independence of each under the Code and the SGX-ST Listing Manual respectively.

Under the Code, an independent director is one who is independent in conduct, character and judgment, and has no or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director's independent business judgement in the best interests of the Company.

Under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, a director will not be independent if he is employed by the company or any of its years, and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee of the company.

The  above  provisions  in  the  Code  and  the  listing  rules  in  the  SGX-ST  Listing  Manual  do  not  apply  to  any  of  the independent Non-Executive Directors.

As  non-executive  members  of  the  Board,  the  independent  Directors  do  not  exercise  management  functions  in  the Company. However, all the Directors have equal responsibility and make contributions towards the performance of the Group.

Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha who have served the Board for independent Directors via the Two-Tier Voting in separate resolutions.

With the passing of the Two-Tier Voting resolutions, the continued appointment of each of Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng Martha as an Independent Director of the Company continue in force until the earlier of: (i) the retirement or resignation of the Independent Director as a Director; or (ii) the conclusion of the third AGM of the Company following the passing of these Ordinary Resolutions. Mr Phua Bah Lee ceased to be an Independent Director on 26 December 2021 with his demise.

In their annual assessment on the independence of Directors who have served the Board for more than 9 years from the date of their respective appointments as a director, the NC (with Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha each abstaining from deliberation on their continued appointment) and the Board have assessed the independence of each of these four Directors using a holistic approach and taking into account their respective contributions in terms of experience, expertise, professionalism, integrity, objectivity and independent judgement in their engagement with all relevant parties, rather than solely and arbitrarily on basis of length of service

alone. Having performed a rigorous review of their independence, the NC (with Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha each abstaining from deliberation on their continued appointment) and the Board are of the view that these four Directors continue to be independent notwithstanding their  length  of  service,  because  each  of  them  has  consistently  demonstrated strong independence of judgment and integrity  of  character  in  discharging  his or  her  respective responsibilities.  All  the  Independent  Directors  are  sitting  in the respective Board Committees which require special skillset and experience and their contribution are still required at  the  Committees level. Their vast experience enable them to provide the Board and the various Board Committees on which they serve, with pertinent experience and competence to facilitate sound decision-making especially with the challenges brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Their length of service does not in any way interfere with their exercise of independent judgement nor hinder their ability to act in the best interests of the Company. Additionally, they are able to continue to discharge their duties independently with integrity and competency.

The  Board's  non-executive  Directors  constructively  challenge,  help  develop  proposals  on  strategy,  and  review  the performance of Management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance. The Independent Directors, led by the Lead Independent Director, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon meet on a need basis without the are convened, the Lead Independent Director would provide feedback to the Executive Chairman after the meetings. No meeting of the Independent Directors was convened in FY2021.

While the Board has not adopted a formal board diversity policy, it recognises that a diverse Board is an important element which will better support the Company's achievement of its strategic objectives for sustainable development by enhancing the decision-making process of the Board through the perspectives derived from the various skills, business experience, industry discipline, gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical background and nationalities, tenure of service and other distinguishing qualities of the Directors.

The Board has two female members, and Directors with ages ranging from mid-40s to more than 70 years old, who have professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives  on  the  Group's  business  and  direction.

Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon is also the Deputy Board Chairman.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and the CEO, which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Executive Chairman leads the Board to monitor and review the general progress and long-term development of the Company. He ensures the members of the Board receive accurate, timely and clear information in particular about the Company's performance, to enable the Board to make sound decisions, monitor between the Board and Management, and between the executive and non-executive Directors. The CEO manages the daily operations of the Group and implements the Board's policies and decisions.

The NC comprises six members, all of whom are independent non-executive Directors. The Chairperson of the NC is Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and the other members of the NC are Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang.

The  NC  reviews  annually  the  nomination  of  the  relevant  Directors  for  re-election  or  re-appointments  as  well  the independence of Directors. When considering the nomination of Directors for re-appointment, the NC takes into account multiple board representations, and also reviews their independence.

The Board believes in carrying out succession planning for itself, the Board Chairman and the Senior Management team to ensure continuity of leadership. Board renewal is a continuing process and in this regard, the NC reviews annually the composition of the Board and Committees, which includes size and mix, and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment of new Directors, whether in addition to the existing Board members or as replacement of retiring Board members, with a view to identifying any gaps in the Board's skills set taking into account the Group's business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding any resignation or retirement of any Director given the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board.

Where a Director has multiple Board representations, the NC also considers if such a Director is able to adequately carry out his/her responsibilities as a Director of the Company. In this regard, the Board has set a general guideline that the maximum number of listed company board representations which a Director may hold (including representation on the Company's Board) should not be more than seven. These guidelines were established following the careful assessment by the NC and the Board after taking into consideration the scope and complexity of the Company's business. Where assessment through the NC and the approval of the Board are required prior to accepting that appointment.

The  NC  assesses  the  performance  of  all  the  Board  Committees  with  the  assistance  of  self-assessment  checklists completed by each of the Board Committees.

The  annual  evaluation  process  for  each  individual  Director's  performance  comprises  three  parts:  (a)  background information concerning  the Director  including  his  attendance  records at  Board and Board Committee  meetings;  (b) questionnaire for completion by each individual Board member; and (c) the NC's evaluation based on certain assessment parameters.  The  questionnaires  and  the  assessment  parameters  were  recommended  by  the  NC  and  approved  by the Board. The completed questionnaires are then reviewed by the NC before the NC completes its evaluation of the individual Directors.

The results of the individual evaluation of each of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Board Chairman, to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Board Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the re-appointment and re-election of retiring Directors. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board.

The qualitative criteria are set out in a questionnaire covering three main areas relating to Board composition, roles and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information.

Both executive and non-executive Directors receive Directors' fees which are subject to approval by shareholders. When reviewing the structure and level of Directors' fees, the RC takes into consideration the Directors' respective roles and governance practices and regulatory rules. The RC also compares the Company's fee structure against industry practices and ensures that the non-executive Directors are not over-compensated to the extent that their independence may be  compromised.  Other factors  taken  into  consideration  in  the  fee  review  includes  frequency  of  Board  and  Board remuneration.

There are no schemes to encourage non-executive Directors to hold shares in the company so as to better align the interests of such non-executive Directors with the interests of shareholders. However, the Company does not discourage the Directors from holding shares in the Company.

| Allowance for ECL is viewed as a key audit matter as a customers and inherent complexity in the Group's ECL model. The Group's loans and advances to customers represent 76% of its total assets. Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases: risk has not increased significantly since initial increase in credit risk ('Stage 1 ECLs'); or (ii) Lifetime ECLs for financial assets where there initial recognition ('Stage 2 ECLs') or are credit impaired ('Stage 3 ECLs'). including: appropriateness of the methodology and parameters used in the ECL model; identification of credit exposures which have determination of relevant macroeconomic factors for incorporation into the model. In 2021, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to add complexity to the level of judgment required by the Group in calculating the ECL. As a result, the Group exercised significant judgment in determining the required post-model adjustments, including economic scenarios to be applied, to address possible model limitations.   | We tested the design, implementation and operating approval and review processes. We performed sample checks of credit reviews on loans and advances to critically assess the appropriateness of the credit grading and any objective evidence of impairment. We also considered the appropriateness of the criteria designed by management to identify of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For credit impaired exposures, we assessed the reasonableness of management estimates of expected future cashflows, including the realisable value of collaterals if relevant. For non-credit impaired exposures, we reviewed the appropriateness of the ECL methodology and management's assumptions on the parameters used in the ECL model, including probability of default term structure, loss given default, exposure at default and macroeconomic factors. We also tested the accuracy of key data inputs into the ECL models for a sample of exposures as at year-end by checking them against source systems and documents. We independently re-calculated the ECL allowance for a sample of credit exposures to test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations produced by the ECL model. In response to the variability in economic scenarios resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed the reasonableness of the post-model adjustments applied by management. In addition, we considered the adequacy of disclosures of these key Based on our procedures performed, the methodology, assumptions and data adopted by management in the ECL model were considered acceptable and the ECL computation was consistent with the ECL model.   |

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, for consideration.

consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The  right-of-use  asset  is  subsequently  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  from  the  commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is  determined  on  the  same  basis  as  those  of  property  and  equipment.  In  addition,  the  right-of-use  asset  is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease  payments  that  are  not  paid  at  the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined,  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate.  Generally,  the  Group  uses  the  lessee's  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The Group determines the lessee's incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- the  exercise  price  under  a  purchase  option  that  the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise,  lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

Some property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Company up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Company seeks to include extension options in new by the lessors. The Company assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Company reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is

The Company has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $1,003,000.

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital.

The  Board  of  Directors  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  establishment  and  oversight  of  the  Group's  risk management  framework.    The  Board  has  established  the  Risk  Management  Committee  (RMC),  which  is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies.  The RMC reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.

The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risk and adherence to limits. Risk management policies policy decisions and approval on risk exposures including loan limits are approved by the Board of Directors upon meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's loans and advances to customers.  For risk management reporting purposes, the Group considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure.

The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of credit risk  to the RMC,  which  in turn appoints the Credit Control Committee and Credit Portfolio Committee to assist in the management of credit risk.  The  Credit  Control  Committee  develops the credit risk management framework, policies and procedures for review and concurrence by RMC and approval by the Board of Directors. The Credit Control Committee also reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions.

Credit reviews are conducted regularly to monitor the health of the loan portfolio and to detect early signs of weaknesses and deviations.

The Credit Portfolio Committee manages risk on a portfolio-wide basis and recommends alternative portfolio strategies,  analyses  results  of  portfolio  management  actions,  and  develops  portfolio  limits  for  each  portfolio segment for approval by the RMC.  Credit risk concentration is addressed by setting a credit portfolio mix limit and monitoring the  limit  on  a  regular  basis.  The  Credit  Portfolio  Committee  periodically  reviews  the  lending authority framework, portfolio concentration limits and credit stress test framework.

Credit stress tests are also conducted periodically to determine the impact of security values and other stress from plausible adverse scenarios on the Group's loan portfolio.

The SFRS(I) 9 Committee ('SC') works closely with Credit Portfolio Committee and Credit Control Committee to consistently  determine adequate allowances in accordance with the Group's  policies  and procedures relating to  impairment  allowances  and  applicable  accounting  framework  under  SFRS(I)  9.  The  SC  also  reviews  and recommends updates to the Governance &amp; Control Framework of ECL Model as well as the Impairment Allowance Policy.

- exposure at default (EAD).

These components are generally derived from internally developed statistical models using historical, current and

## Probability of default

The 12-month and lifetime PD represent the expected point-in-time probability of a default over the next 12

The PD is derived using Delinquency Roll Rate Model which incorporates historical default rates over past years,

expected value when realised and the time value of money.

## Exposure at default

EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure  to  the  counterparty  and  potential  changes  to  the  current  amount  allowed  under  the  contract  and arising from amortisation. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations.

The 12-month ECL is equal to the discounted sum over the next 12 months of monthly PD multiplied by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the discounted sum of monthly PD over the full remaining life multiplied by LGD and EAD.

Post-model adjustments (PMAs) are short-term adjustments to the ECL balance as part of the year-end reporting regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how such scenarios are incorporated in the calculations.

The Group has internal governance frameworks and controls in place to assess the appropriateness of PMAs. The aim of the Group is to incorporate these PMAs into the ECL models, where possible, as part of the periodic recalibration and model assessment procedures.

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

## Currency risk

foreign exchange rates.  The Group is not exposed to foreign currency risk.

## Interest rate risk

The overall objective of interest rate risk management is to manage current and future earnings sensitivity arising from various interest rate exposures.  Interest rate risk exposures are measured using a combination of repricing gap, present value of 1 basis point reports and simulation modelling.  The ALCO recommends policies, ratios and limits for review and concurrence by RMC and approval by the Board of Directors. The RMC assists the Board in Group against the prevailing business and economic conditions, focusing on market and interest rate risks.  The ALCO also relates the structure of assets and liabilities to funding mismatches and interest rate repricing risks and ensure compliance with the approved policies and risk exposures (including ratios and limits).

The Group does not hold a trading portfolio.  The principal risk to which its non-trading portfolio is exposed arises in market interest rates.  Interest rate risk is managed principally through monitoring interest rate gaps and by having pre-approved limits for repricing bands.

The Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group's loan and investment portfolios as well manages this risk through diversity in its loan portfolio and to a lesser extent in its deposit portfolio.

## Interest rate risk

Interest rate sensitivity analyses are performed under various interest rate scenarios using simulation modelling where the sensitivity of projected net interest income is measured against changes in market interest rates.

The projected impact on future net interest income before tax over the next twelve months from the close of the year is simulated under various interest rate assumptions.  Based on a 100 basis point parallel rise in yield curves by $303,000).  The corresponding impact from a 100 basis point fall is an estimated reduction of $3,484,000 (2020: $2,817,000) in net interest income.

The sensitivity analysis of the Group is illustrative only.  It assumes that interest rates of all tenors move by the maturity without action by the Group to mitigate any impact of such changes.

## Portfolio price risk

At  the  reporting  date,  the  Group  has  FVOCI-debt  instruments  on  Singapore  Government  Securities  of approximately  $131  million  (2020:  $123  million).    A  1%  increase  in  prices  at  the  reporting  date  would  have increased  equity  by  $1.3  million  (2020:  $1.2  million).    An  equal  change  in  the  opposite  direction  would  have decreased equity by $1.3 million (2020: $1.2 million).  The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2020.

increase in prices at the reporting date would have increased equity by $ * (2020: $0.2 million).  An equal change

The sensitivity analysis is based on management's best estimate of the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change.

that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.

Although management have employed their best judgement in the estimation of fair values, there is inevitably below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Group could have realised in a sales transaction at the reporting date.

The  methodologies  and  assumptions  used  depend  on  the  terms  and  risk  characteristics  of  the  various instruments and include the following:

The carrying values of statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, other receivables and deposits, cash and balances with banks and trade and other payables, approximate their fair values as these balances are short-term in nature or are receivable or payable on demand.

The fair values of FVOCI-debt instruments are determined by reference to their quoted closing bid prices at the reporting date.

In 2021, the fair value of the FVOCI-equity instrument is determined by reference to a recent transaction price. In

The fair value of loans and advances that mature or reprice within six months of the reporting date is assumed to equate to the carrying value.  The fair value of all other loans and advances was calculated using discounted cash current interest rates of similar types of loans.

The  fair  value  of  deposits  and  savings  accounts  of  customers  which  mature  or  reprice  within  six  months  is estimated to be the carrying value at the reporting date.  The fair value of other term deposits was calculated applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of deposits.
