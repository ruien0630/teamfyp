On  behalf  of  the  Board  of  Directors, I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Annual Report  and  Financial  Statements  of the  Group  and  the  Company  for  the financial  year  ended  31  December 2022 ('FY2022').

## PERFORMANCE REVIEW

The  external  operating  environment for FY2022 continued to be challenging even as COVID-19 eases. Cost of funds have  increased  due  to  interest  rate hikes to curb inflation. Under  this difficult business environment, the Group recorded a profit after tax of $8.3 million,  a  decline  of  13.2%  compared to last year. The weaker performance was primarily due to higher operating expenses and impairment allowances on loans.

Net interest income and hiring charges improved  by  6.6%  to  $26.2  million compared  to  $24.6  million  last  year. Total  interest  income  rose  by  $4.5m or 15.0% mainly attributed to the increase in interest income from loans and advances, Singapore Government Securities  ('SGS')  and  other  interest earning assets amidst a higher interest rate environment. Correspondingly, total interest expense increased sharply by $2.8m or 56.3% during the year. Non-interest income declined

The Group is mindful of  the challenges ahead and will be proactive in managing our net interest margin in the environment of  rising interest rates and continue to manage our risk exposures closely. The Group continues its aim to stay relevant and competitive as we continue to forge ahead with our digital transformation to sustain the Group's long-term growth for the benefit of  all our stakeholders.

by  $0.6  million  or  42.1%  mainly  due to the curtailment of the Government Covid-19 grants. Total operating expenses  increased  by  17.0%  or  $2.2 million  compared  to  last  year  as  the Group continued to forge ahead with our digital transformation.

There was a net charge for loan impairment losses amounting to $1.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2022  compared  to  $1.2  million  for year  ended  31  December  2021.  The Group continues to set aside adequate specific  and  collective  allowances  in respect of its loan portfolio.

The Group's shareholders' funds remain  robust  at  $252  million  as  at 31 December 2022, and is more than adequate to buffer further volatility in the  current  economic  slowdown.  Our capital adequacy ratio continues to be well  above  the  regulatory  minimum requirement.

Fair  value  reserve  for  the  year  ended 31  December  2022  declined  by  $6.2 million  due  to  decrease  in  the  fair value of the SGS. The Group purchases SGS  for  the  purposes  of  maintaining minimum  liquid  assets  as  required under the Finance Companies Act.

The Group's total loan, net of allowances,  dipped  by  5.7%  to  $844 million as at 31 December 2022 compared to $896 million as at 31  December  2021.  In  line  with  the lower  loan  balance,  total  customers' deposits were managed downwards by 1.6% to $894 million as at 31 December 2022  compared  to  $908  million  as  at 31 December 2021.

In the opinion of the Directors, no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual  nature  has  arisen  which  is likely to affect substantially the results of  the  operations  of  the  Group  and the  Company in the interval  between the end of the financial period and the date of this report.

## DIVIDENDS

Subject  to  approval  of  shareholders at  the  forthcoming  Annual  General Meeting,  the  Board  is  recommending a  first  and  final  one-tier  tax  exempt dividend of 2.0 cents per share and a special  one-tier  tax  exempt  dividend of  1.25  cents  per  share  for  FY2022. The  total  distribution  of  3.25  cents per share for the year will amount to approximately $5.16 million.

## OPERATIONS REVIEW

2022 was a defining year for the Group. We  launched  our  mobile  application and web-based online services SFL Go for  retail  customers  and  SFL  IBiz  for corporate customers by October 2022. The  launch  is  a  key  enabler  for  our Group to better serve our customers, to remain relevant and connect to the younger and tech-savvy customers and to catch up with the competition, especially  with  the  new  digital  banks. Even as COVID-19 eases, the Group will continue to forge ahead with our digital transformation  initiatives  to  improve and streamline our work processes.

The Group remains committed to drive the  digitalization  of  customer  touchpoints without compromising the security of transactions. Our journey to implement digital touch points adopts a  security  by  design  and  zero-trust strategies.  We  continue  to  be  vigilant and  bolster  our  monitoring  of  cyber related security risks.

The Group is committed to be a responsible  corporate  citizen  and  is actively  playing  our  part  to  reduce our  carbon  footprint.  In  our  support to align its corporate philosophy, strategy and goals to the government's vision  of  green  finance,  the  Group has in place a framework for its environmental  risk  management  in  a manner  that  commensurate  with  the Group's size. The underlying structure of the framework recognizes that environmental risk poses potential financial  and  reputational  impact  to the Company.

## OUTLOOK

Looking  ahead  to  2023,  GDP  growth rates  in  most  major  economies  are expected to moderate from 2022 levels, with sharp slowdowns projected in  the  US  and  Eurozone.  Meanwhile, global supply disruptions are likely to  continue  into  2023  as  the  war  in Ukraine  drags  on,  even  though  the extent and frequency of disruptions is expected to ease. In the US, GDP growth is  projected  to  slow  significantly,  as tighter financial conditions, a reduction in  household  savings,  and  negative household wealth effects arising from asset market corrections are expected to weigh on private consumption. Similarly, GDP growth in the Eurozone is forecast to slow sharply. In particular, higher cost pressures arising from significant energy disruptions due to  the  Russia-Ukraine  war,  alongside tighter  financial  conditions,  are  likely to dampen consumption and industrial production.

At the same time, significant uncertainties  and  downside  risks  in the global economy remain. First, with many advanced economies raising  interest  rates  simultaneously to  combat  high  inflation,  the  impact of tightening financial conditions on global growth could be larger than expected. Second, financial stability  risks  could  intensify  if  there are disorderly market adjustments to  monetary  policy  tightening  in  the advanced economies. A sharp repricing of assets could trigger capital outflows from  the  region  and  increase  debt servicing burdens, thereby dampening regional  economies'  growth  outlook. Third,  further  escalations  in  the  war in  Ukraine  and  geopolitical  tensions among  major  global powers could worsen  supply  disruptions,  dampen consumer and business confidence, as well as weigh on global trade.

Amid  these  global  uncertainties  and headwinds, the Ministry of Trade and Industry  ('MTI')  forecast  Singapore's economic  growth  to  slow  to  0.5%  to 2.5% in 2023, moderating from growth

## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

of  3.6%  and  8.9%  in  2022  and  2021 respectively. The Group  is mindful of  the  challenges  ahead  and  will  be proactive in managing our net interest margin  in  the  environment  of  rising interest rates and continue to manage our risk exposures closely. The Group continues its aim to stay relevant and competitive  as  we  continue  to  forge ahead with our digital transformation to sustain the Group's long-term growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

As I reflect on the last two challenging years of the pandemic, and witnesses the  Group's  strength  and  adaptability to  excel  and  thrive  throughout  this period,  it  gives  me  confidence  that the same spirit of resilience and perseverance will persist in the future to generate sustainable value to all our stakeholders

On  behalf  of  the  Board,  I  would  like to extend my  appreciation to our valued clients and business associates for  their  continued  support  and  to our  shareholders  for  their  patience and loyalty. I thank my fellow Board  members  for  their  continual support, counsel and guidance. I also acknowledge and commend our  management  and  staff  for  their diligence and hard work in contributing to  the  development  of  the  Group  in 2022.

Our dividend policy aims to provide shareholders with sustainable dividend return over the long term by balancing growth with prudent capital management and subject to the profitability  of  the  Group.

## ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE

For the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group recorded a profit after tax of $8.3 million, a decline of 13.2% compared to last year. The weaker performance was primarily due to higher  operating  expenses  and  impairment  allowances  on loans.

Net  interest  income  and  hiring  charges  improved  by  6.6% to  $26.2  million  compared  to  $24.6  million  last  year.  Total interest  income  rose  by  $4.5m  or  15.0%  mainly  attributed to the increase in interest income from loans and advances, Singapore Government Securities ('SGS') and other interest earning  assets  amidst  a  higher  interest  rate  environment. Correspondingly, total interest expense increased sharply by $2.8m or 56.3% during the year. Non-interest income declined by  $0.6  million  or  42.1%  mainly  due  to  the  curtailment  of the Government Covid-19 grants. Total operating expenses increased  by  17.0%  or  $2.2  million  compared  to  last  year as  the  Group  continued  to  forge  ahead  with  our  digital transformation.

There was a net charge for loan impairment losses amounting to $1.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2022 compared to $1.2 million for year ended 31 December 2021. The Group continues to set aside adequate specific and collective allowances in respect of its loan portfolio.

The  Group's  shareholders'  funds  remain  robust  at  $252 million as at 31 December 2022, and is more than adequate to buffer further volatility in the current economic slowdown. Our capital  adequacy ratio  continues  to  be  well  above  the regulatory minimum requirement.

Fair  value  reserve  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2022 declined  by  $6.2  million  due  to  decrease  in  the  fair  value

of  the  SGS.  The  Group  purchases  SGS  for  the  purposes  of maintaining  minimum  liquid  assets  as  required  under  the Finance Companies Act.

Net interest income rose by $1.6m or 6.6% for the financial year  ended  31  December  2022  compared  to  the  same period last  year  mainly  due  to  higher  yield  from  interestearning assets.

Total  interest  income  rose  by  $4.5m  or  15.0%  mainly attributed  to  the  increase  in  interest  income  from  loans and advances, Singapore Government Securities and other interest earning assets amidst a higher interest rate environment.

Correspondingly, total  interest  expense  increased  sharply by $2.8m or 56.3% as our average cost of funds spiked from 0.55% to 0.90% during the year.

As  the  rate  of  increase  in  assets  yield  is  higher  than  that of  cost  of  funds,  the  Group's  net  interest  margin  as  a percentage  of  the  interest-earning  assets  improved  from 2.16% to 2.35%.

by 1.6% to $894 million as at 31 December 2022 compared to $908 million as at 31 December 2021.

In the opinion of the Directors, no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen which is likely to  affect  substantially  the  results  of  the  operations  of  the Group and the Company in the interval between the end of the financial period and the date of this report.

| Total Equity   | 252,222      | 256,376      | (1.6)        |

The decrease in total equity was mainly due to the decline in the fair value reserve with the drop in the prices of Singapore Government Securities. These investments are held primarily for Minimum Liquid Assets ('MLA') purpose.

## BOARD STATEMENT

The  Board  of  Directors  ('the  Board') is pleased to present our sixth Sustainability Report (the 'Report').

At Singapura Finance Ltd ('SFL' and the 'Company'), we consider environmental,  social  and  governance ('ESG') issues in our business strategies and operations whilst driving business growth. The Company takes a strategic approach  that  is  guided  by  our  core values  of  Shareholder  Value,  People Development, Integrity, Customer Focus and Efficiency ('S.P.I.C.E').

Together with Management, the Board continues to identify opportunities relevant  to  the  long-term  success  of the  Company.  The  Board  considers ESG factors  as  one  of  the  priorities  in SFL's business strategy, thus driving the materiality assessment. The Board also sets the direction for SFL's sustainability strategies.

This year, SFL re-validated the material ESG factors that were identified previously  as  of  high  importance  to our  business  and  stakeholders.  The Sustainability Steering Committee ('SSC') continues to support the Board  in  overseeing  the  management and  monitoring  of  these  factors.  The considerations and priorities taken into  account  in  choosing  the  relevant material ESG factors focus on the development of our business, the wellbeing of our employees, the experience of  our  customers,  and  the  impacts  to our environment.

In this Report, we are proud to share our sustainability  approach  as  well  as  our sustainability progress for the financial year  ended  31  December  2022.  This year, we have enhanced our Report by deepening our performance disclosures and  demonstrating  our  commitment to sustainability by reducing water and energy consumption compared to previous years.

The Board would like to thank all who have  been  with  us  throughout  our sustainability journey. We will continue our  sustainability  efforts  in  order  to enhance the long-term value and trust to our stakeholders.

1. S.P.I.C.E: Shareholder Value, People Development, Integrity, Customer Focus and Efficiency.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

## ABOUT THIS REPORT

This  Report  covers  our  sustainability approach and performance  for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 ('FY2022').

The  scope  of  this  Report  focuses  on SFL's key business activities in Singapore -  deposit  services  and  financing  for business  and  individuals.  This  Report is developed in reference to the Global Reporting  Initiative  ('GRI')  Standards, as it is the most established and widely used international sustainability reporting standard. This Report is prepared  per  the  GRI  standards  'in reference'  option.    The  sustainability framework is reviewed every 12 months. This Report is also aligned with the Singapore Exchange SGX-ST Listing Rules  Practice  Note  7.6:  'Sustainability Reporting Guide'.

A  formal  materiality  assessment  was first  conducted  in  FY2017  to  identify ESG  risks  and  opportunities  that  are most  important  to  our  business  and stakeholders. The material factors are  reviewed  every  12  months.  The materiality  assessment  was  guided  by the  GRI  Principles  of  Materiality  and Stakeholder  Engagement  as  well  as our  core  values  of  S.P.I.C.E 1 ,  and  the material  issues  were  prioritised  based on the following factors:

-  SFL's existing risk analysis and disclosures and its long-term strategy vision;
-  Global and local emerging trends;
-  Main  topics  and  future  challenges for  the  financial  services  sector,  as identified by peers; and
-  Insights gained from interactions with both internal and external stakeholders.

## SUSTAINABILITY AT SFL

SFL's SSC consists of senior management team members.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

## Stakeholder Engagement

SFL's  sustainability  depends  on  strong  connections  to  our  diverse  range  of  stakeholders.  We  are  committed  to  having transparent and effective communication with all stakeholders to allow a deep understanding of their views and expectations. This allows us to refine our sustainability strategy in line with stakeholder concerns to remain agile and able address emerging challenges.

We have identified five key stakeholder groups in previous years, which we have reviewed and reconfirmed for FY2022. SFL engages each stakeholder group through different methods which allows a better understanding of individual group views and expectations (Table 1).

## Economic Performance

[GRI 2-6, GRI 3-3, GRI 201-1, GRI 203-2, GRI 204-1]

Economic growth is one of the primary factors that contributes  to  the  business  continuity  of  SFL;  and  it  is crucial that we continue to be prepared and resilient against potential disruptions in our business strategies or operations. In  FY2022, domestic financing conditions have tightened in line  with  international trends as major central banks hiked interest  rates  aggressively  to  bring  down  inflation 11 .  SFL aims to be proactive in managing our credit exposure and operating expenses to be economically resilient in the wake of these macroeconomic conditions.

Our  economic  value  distributed  include  our  employees' compensations, taxes as well as dividends to shareholders. SFL  strives  to  provide  shareholders  with  a  predictable  and sustainable dividend return over the long term. The Company is proposing a first and final one-tier tax exempt dividend of 2.0 cents per share and a special one-tier tax exempt dividend of  1.25  cents  per  share  for  FY2022  subject  to  approval  of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2023.

SFL  is  committed  to  being  sustainable  in  our  economic growth  to  enhance  our  shareholder's  returns  and  deliver rewards to our employees. For more information regarding our economic performance in FY2022, please refer to pages 67 to 123 of the Annual Report.

## Indirect Economic Impact

[GRI 2-6, GRI 3-3, GRI 201-1, GRI 203-2, GRI 204-1]

SFL has an indirect economic impact in the local Singapore region. We support the Sustainable Development Goal ('SDG') of Decent Work and Economic Growth by providing financing and  other  financial  services  to  SMEs,  local  companies  and individuals. In 2022, our lending business contracted by S$50 million (-5.6%) mainly due to loan repayment by syndicated loan  borrowers.  Furthermore,  SFL  faces  keen  competition from other financial institutions who provide lower interest rates.

Additionally,  SFL  indirectly  drives  and  contributes  to  the local economy by providing employment opportunities and sourcing from local suppliers.  In FY2022, we have increased our percentage of local spending to 99% (Table 3), thereby continuing  our  goal  of  providing  support  to  the  local suppliers. Going forward, SFL aims to continue enhancing our positive influences on the local economy by growing our lending business and sourcing from local suppliers.

## Responsible Lending

[GRI 3-3]

SFL's management  is  committed  to  ensuring  that our sustainability  strategy  is  embedded  into  our  responsible financing  practices.  In  recent  years,  increasing  responsible lending practices have been developed and adopted in the industry. It is currently an industry trend and best practice. Our  management  continues  their  efforts  in  supporting the  Association  of  Banks  Singapore  ('ABS')  Guidelines  on Responsible Financing.

We have a  Credit  Risk  Management  Policy  which  provides guidelines on  establishing and  reviewing  risk tolerance parameters  within  our  credit  strategy.  The  policy  ensures the  creditworthiness  of  the  clients  before  entering  into  a regulated  credit  agreement  or  significantly  increasing  their credit  limit.  This  ensures  that  we  do  not  take  on  excessive credit risks. Furthermore, we have a Marketing Manual that formalises our lending guidelines as well as processes for due diligence.

The  management  is  looking  to  expand  existing  practices towards a more robust lending practice in line with responsible  lending  trends  in  the  banking  industry.  Since FY2022, SFL has started to operationalise the Environmental Risk Management Framework based on guidelines provided by MAS and ABS.

Moving  forward,  SFL  plans  to  look  out  for  opportunities on  electric  vehicles  financing  in  the  green  financing  space. Employees  will  be  provided  with  training  on  sustainable finance to build up capability.

## ENVIRONMENTAL

## Energy and Emissions

[GRI 3-3, GRI 302-1, GRI 302-3, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4]

In line with Singapore's Climate Action Plan to build a 'ClimateResilient Singapore, for a Sustainable Future' 12 , SFL strives to continue contributing to this movement by reducing our own environmental and carbon footprint.

To do so, we have implemented policies and procedures to manage our energy use such as educating our employees and engaging them in matters concerning energy consumption. As part of our 'Go Green' initiative, we have communicated green information periodically using both formal and informal communication tools to encourage our employees to be more energy efficient. For example, we remind our employees to increase the temperature on air-conditioners where possible and to switch off IT devices and air-conditioners when they are not in use. SFL monitors our electricity bills diligently to identify and address any abnormal usage as well as rectify any equipment malfunctioning.

Since FY2019, recycling bins have been installed in our office and we continue to encourage our employees to adopt better recycling habits.

Electricity usage is our main source of energy consumption. In FY2022, SFL achieved our target of maintaining the energy consumption  and  GHG  emissions.  Additionally,  in  FY2022, we converted all lightings  in  Head  Office  and  all  Customer Centres to LED lighting. SFL's annual electricity consumption decreased  by  11.6%  from  FY2021  to  FY2022,  with  a  19% decrease  from  FY2017  (Figure  1A).  Energy  intensity  per employee also reduced by more than 10% from FY2021 to FY2022  with  an  overall  decrease  from  FY2017  to  FY2022 by 17% (Figure 1B). In FY2023, our energy target is not to exceed  the  previous  year's  energy  consumption  by  more than 2%.

Going forward, SFL has plans to start the process of adopting the  Task  Force  on  Climate  Related  Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations in line with SGX requirements.

From  July  FY2020,  80%  of  SFL's  marketing  documentation process, including the submission of credit proposals, supporting  documents  and  correspondences  have  gone paperless. The adoption of e-submission has enabled SFL to reduce usage of paper and ink, contributing to our 'Go Green' efforts and reducing cost of waste. In FY2023, SFL will begin to utilise Google Cloud, a carbon-neutral service provider to host some systems and servers.

## Water Consumption

[GRI 303-5]

In  FY2020, SFL added Water Consumption as an additional disclosure (non-material  GRI  factor).  Population  growth, increasing  meat  consumption  and  economic  activity  are putting a heavy strain on the world's water resources. Although Water  Consumption  was  not  considered  as  a  material factor to SFL in the previous years, SFL has been raising the awareness of water conservation among employees.

Water  consumption  is  the  amount  of  water  used  in  SFL premises  annually. Water  consumption  intensity  is the amount of water used per employee annually. From FY2020 to FY2022, water consumption decreased by 63% and water consumption intensity decreased by 62% (Figure 2).

The following figures present SFL's annual water consumption (m³) and water consumption intensity by number of employees (m³/employee).

**Description**: The image is a bar graph illustrating the trend of water consumption per employee from FY2020 to FY2022, measured in cubic meters per employee. The graph shows a decreasing trend: FY2020 had a water consumption of 11.5 m³/employee, which decreased by -51.9% to 5.5 m³/employee in FY2021. Finally, the water consumption further decreased by -21.0% to 4.4 m³/employee in FY2022, with the FY2022 bar highlighted in orange.


We continue to encourage the reduction of water consumption for all employees by reminding employees in customer  centres  to  use  water  conservatively  at  all  times. Going  forward,  SFL  will  continue  to  assess  initiatives  to reduce  water  consumption  and  aim  to  maintain  current consumption levels as per previous years.

## (i)  Recruitment

We continue to embrace the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment  Practices  in  recruiting  talents  regardless of their gender, race, religion, cultural and family background. For example, SFL values the experience of the  older  generation  and  supports  them  to  re-join  the workforce.  Where  eligible,  SFL  extends  re-employment opportunities to eligible staff upon their retirement.

SFL recruits  potential  employees through a vast range of  channels  such  as  collaborating  with  professional recruitment consultants, leveraging on internet recruitment  platforms  and  encouraging  staff  referrals. In  FY2022,  we've  maintained  online  interviews  to  suit current hybrid working models. In FY2022, 25% of new employee  hires  were  male  and  75%  were  female (Figure  3).  Furthermore,  21%  of  new  hires  were  under the age of thirty, 54% were between thirty and fifty years old and 25% was over the age of fifty (Figure 3). Below charts represent the percentage of new employee hires by gender and age group.

Chart B illustrates age distribution, with 21% of the data representing individuals under 30 years old, 54% representing those aged 30-50 years old, and 25% representing individuals over 50 years old.


## (ii) Employment Practices

We have set in place various schemes such as cross training and inter-departmental transfers to enhance diversity  of  employee's  job  scope  where  possible. This  practice  provides  employees  with  new  learning opportunities  and  cultivate  expertise.  This  platform also  encourages  meetings  between  colleagues  from different departments which helps bridge interdepartmental  understanding  and  synergies.  This  will help  to  improve  the  camaraderie  and  collaborative culture within SFL. Furthermore, conversing with colleagues from other departments can inspire more creative  solutions  as  they  are  able  to  offer  fresh perspectives.

We  also  adopt  an  open  appraisal  system  for  our employees to set goals and receive feedback. A formal appraisal exercise is conducted annually to align and assess  each  employee's  growth  and  development. During  the  session,  targets  and  performance  are discussed  and  documented  properly  to  recognise individual progress.

SFL  dedicates  its  time  and  efforts  on  an  open-door policy by establishing a platform for employees to clarify on  policies,  raise  concerns  to  the  management  and initiate discussions on areas for improvements as well as career aspirations with their Heads of Departments ('HOD')  or  HR.  HODs  will  conduct  informal  feedback sessions  to  address  our  employees  concerns  when necessary.

## (iii)	 Remuneration	Policies	and	Staff	Benefits

Adopting  competitive  remuneration  policy  effectively helps  SFL  to  retain  top  talents.  Remuneration  and benefits are benchmarked against compensation reports and surveys. Salary revision and any variable  benefits  are  reviewed  and  approved  by  the management annually to ensure fairness in rewarding our employees.

Other  than  a  competitive  remuneration  policy,  SFL hopes  to  enrich  the  work  life  of  our  employees  by providing  a  wide  variety  of  staff  benefits,  such  as medical, dental, insurance and wellness for the employee.  Since  FY2019,  we  have  integrated  dental and  health  screening  benefits  into  wellness  benefits to enhance the flexibility of employee benefit claims. Specifically,  employees  can  decide  the  proportion  of dental or health screening benefits to use depending on  their  needs.  Our  benefits  policies  are  reviewed periodically to ensure relevance.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

## (iv)  Employee Well-being

We believe that a good workplace is where employees can  achieve  work-life  balance  and  establish  a  strong sense  of belonging. Therefore, we  offer different initiatives  and  benefits  to  promote  health  and  wellbeing, to build a healthy work environment.

Since  FY2018,  we  have  implemented  flexible  working arrangement  where  employees  can  opt  for  flexible working  hours  to  balance  their  personal  and  work commitments. Employees are able to  apply  for  staggered working arrangements, with different reporting times to accommodate family responsibilities. We managed to  achieve  our  target  of  having  more  employees  on board this program, with 12 employees enrolled in the program in FY2022. We have received positive feedback from our employees on this arrangement. SFL aims to continue to support our employees in achieving worklife balance.

SFL  encourages  our  employees  to  exercise  and  stay healthy.  Every  year,  SFL  participates  in  the  National Steps  Corporate  Challenge,  organised  by  the  Health Promotion Board to encourage the adoption of an  active  lifestyle.  For  2022,  we  encourage  staff  to participate and  close to 45% of employees sign up for the National Steps Corporate Challenge.

We  also aspire to build better teamwork  within the  Company  to  strengthen  our  cohesiveness  and efficiency.  Every  year,  we  aim  to  promote  a  positive and engaging work environment for all employees by conducting at least three company events each year. This encourages  participation from  our  staff  and fosters a stronger sense of recognition.

Moving forward, we aim to encourage flexible working arrangements to more employees when needed, as a means of supporting work-life balance.

## (v)   Exit

SFL conducts exit interviews with employees to understand  their  reasons  for  leaving  and  schedule follow-ups  as  part  of  our  efforts  to  improve  on  our retention policies and practices.

We collect ad-hoc feedback from our employees and conduct benchmarking analysis against industry practice and government initiatives to make improvements  to  our  staff  policies  and  initiatives.  In addition, we analyse the difference in gender and age category in turnover (Figure 4) which reflects our total employee gender and age split. Our retention policies are recognised by our employees and reflected from the large number of long serving employees.

Chart (B) represents age distribution, with 11% being under 30 years old (orange), 57% being 30-50 years old (grey), and 32% being over 50 years old (blue).


For talent retention, the HODs engage our employees actively, and  conduct  annual  performance  appraisals.  There  is  a Performance Improvement Plan for staff  who  may  require corrective actions.  HODs are also responsible for assigning projects  to  high-potential  staff  to  assess  their  capability and  competencies.  Rewards  in  the  form  of  performance bonus  and  merit  increment/promotions  are  given  to  high performing employees to retain talents.

## Diversity and Equal Opportunity

[GRI 405-1]

We believe in enforcing fair employment practices across all levels of the Company. Active promotion of diversity and equality at work can generate significant benefits for both SFL and our employees. In FY2022, 25% percent of the Board was female and 75% was male compared to 22% female and 78% male in FY2021 (Figure 5). The percentage of Board members between 30 to 50 years old decreased by 8% in FY2022 compared to FY2021 (Figure 6). The proportion of employees based on gender remained largely the same between FY2021 and FY2022 with a 2% decrease of males (Figure 7) out of a total of 102 full-time employees (Table 5).

![Image](output_md\Singapura Finance - Annual Report 2022_artifacts\image_000034_b3421c8ac6715e339b9922910cea2c42eacde764b61338cb76a0563372de9507.png)
**Description**: The image presents three pairs of donut charts comparing data from FY2021 and FY2022, each pair focusing on a different aspect: the gender of the Board of Directors members (showing a slight decrease in male representation from 78% to 75%), the age of the Board of Directors members (indicating an increase in members over 50 years old from 67% to 75%), and the gender of permanent employees (reflecting a minimal change in male representation, decreasing from 32% to 30%).

## Training and Education

[GRI 3-3, GRI 404-1, GRI 404-2]

We aim to nurture our employees through extensive training and development programs. In the fast-paced and ever-changing financial  industry,  SFL  enables  employees  to  have  the  opportunity  to  upskill  themselves,  allowing  them  to  improve  their existing skillsets and stay relevant. Examples of other trainings and education initiatives conducted during the year are listed in Table 7.

Table 7 . Examples of training for SFL employees in FY2022.

Moving forward, we will continue to identify and offer relevant trainings to employees to enhance their career and professional development and ensure they continue to meet 100% attendance for all mandatory training requirements for their roles. Furthermore, we aim to develop more online trainings to ease employees' access to trainings. For FY2022, our Digital Banking team have provided trainings to all employees from the Customer Centres to enhance their knowledge for better customer

## Customer Privacy

[GRI 418-1]

Keeping  our  customers'  data  safe  is  a  top  priority  as  our customers entrust us with sensitive and confidential information. Prevention of any breaches of customer privacy  secures  our  customers'  confidence  in  our  products and  services,  leading  to  customer  loyalty.  Our  Information Security  Office  and  Information  Services  Department  are responsible  for  safeguarding  our  customers'  data  through the  stringent  practices  of  data  privacy  on  sensitive  and confidential information.

With cyberattacks on the rise, customers have a strong need for  organizations  they  can  trust  to  protect  their  personal privacy  with  robust  policies.  SFL  has  multiple  policies  and processes in place to ensure a 'Zero breach' on data privacy. SFL  complies  with  the  Personal  Data  Protection  Act  2012 ('PDPA') and follows an Information Security Policy that has been  approved  by  our  Operational  and  Technology  Risk Committee ('OPTECH') and the Risk Management Committee ('RMC').  The  OPTECH  is  updated  bi-monthly,  and  RMC  is updated quarterly to ensure their relevance and coverage. Our compliance department also signs up for the MAS mailing list for regular updates and the accounts department will check MASNET daily for any announcements or circulars which will be forwarded to the compliance department. The compliance department  then  ensures  that  any  changes  in  regulations are communicated to the relevant departments within three working days for further action. We have implemented and revised  our  policies  to  secure  sensitive  data,  such  as  SFL's Information Security Policy, Portable Storage Devices Policy and Mobile Device Acceptable Use and Security Policy.

In FY2022, we achieved our target on continuing to maintain zero  complaints  concerning  breaches  of  customer  privacy and losses of customer data. SFL aims to continue this target in FY2023. For more information on the Privacy Policy, please visit SFL's company website 15 .

## Marketing and Labelling

[GRI 3-3, GRI 417-2, GRI 417-3]

SFL recognises the importance of fair representation through labelling and communication to ensure customer confidence in  our  services  and  to  protect  our  corporate  image.  For instance, we adhere strictly to our marketing and advertising guidelines and practice good corporate governance within the Company. This is to ensure that key information presented is clear and accurate.

SFL provides trainings for our Relationship Managers ('RM') for  products,  policies,  market  updates  etc.  We  ensure  that our RMs are trained to deal with customers clearly and fairly, and that they receive coaching on AML and our Company's internal policies.

Our marketing material contents are reviewed and assessed by  the  Marketing  Department  and  the  Communications Department  for  appropriateness  and  accuracy  to  reach  to the targeted audience and achieve desired communication outcomes.

To  safeguard  confidential  information  and  prevent  data leakage,  we  have  implemented  the  Data  Loss  Prevention ('DLP') in the system. All employees are required to attend and complete an assessment on security awareness

We have achieved our target of having no reported incidents for non-compliance with voluntary codes nor non-compliance with  regulations  resulting  in  a  significant  fine,  penalty  or

warning in respect of product and service information and labelling and marketing communications in FY2022. SFL aims to continue this performance in the following year.

## Assessment for Agents and Customers

[GRI 3-3]

We practice screening and due diligence on referral agents  prior  to  any  engagement.  Different  assessments, including  company  search  and  World-Check  search  on  the referral  agency;  litigation  search  and  World-Check  search on company's directors as well as assessment on their key personnel  experiences  are  conducted  to  reduce  risk  in debt  issues.  Other  screening  methods  include  conducting research on the property agents who refer property loans to SFL online. The research ensures that they hold a valid license issued by Council for Estate Agencies ('CEA').

SFL  also  issues  guidelines  and  implement  procedures  on customer  due  diligence.  These  include  approved  lending guidelines, independent review by the RMC as well as type and frequency of valuation for collateral.

We categorise our customers and initiate Know Your Customer ('KYC') procedures to meet our business needs. Customers such  as  individual  applicants  and  personal  guarantors  are screened  via  Credit  Bureau  Singapore  ('CBS'),  litigation and blacklist search as well as World-Check search. On the other hand, corporate clients and corporate guarantors are screened via CBS FICO 16 , litigation search and blacklist search as well as World-Check search.

The rigor of our assessment is also based on the collateral value and levels of risks. Effective and progressive procedures are in place to better manage risks and ensure sustainable economic success. As a continuous practice at SFL, different functions share responsibilities to ensure the effectiveness of our assessment.

- The  Risk  Management  Department  ('RMD')  performs independent assessments for loans more than $5 million on an obligor basis.
- The Credit Control Committee reviews and approves for monthly monitoring of non-performing loans ('NPL').
- Relationship  Managers  initiate  regular  visits  for  higher valued loans and customers in more high-risk industries such as oil and gas, construction and hospitality.
- Credit Control Department and Credit Control Committee proactively  monitor  payment  patterns  on  a  daily  and monthly basis respectively.

Additionally, active performing loans ('APL') need to undergo bi-annual  indicative  valuation  while  NPL  undergo  quarterly indicative valuation. Any  shortfall in collateral value is reported to the Credit Control Committee.

16. A FICO score is a credit score created by the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO).

In  2022,  all  new  referral  agents  were  screened  for  their responsible practices before we engaged them. The Marketing  Department  screens  on  new  applicants  while the  Credit  Review  Department  screens  existing  applicants. All new customers were also screened for their profiles and repayment  ability.  We  have  achieved  our  targets  and  will continue the good practice, to maintain 100% screening for new customers and agents in the following year.

## Customer Experience

[GRI 3-3]

We  strive  to  explore  more  innovations  to  bring  a  better customer experience to our diverse customers. In line with SFL's core values of customer focus and efficiency, we believe that a pleasant and positive experience is essential in building our brand.

In  order  to  better  understand  the  expectations  from  our customers,  we  have  opened  a  variety  of  communication channels, such as our official website, email, and feedback forms.  To  allow  for  more  immediate  feedback,  we  also implemented a new feedback system via Facebook Messenger.  Customers  have  responded  well  to  this  new feedback channel with most enquiries centred on SFL's Vivid Savings accounts 17 .

In  FY2022,  SFL  met  the  target  set  in  FY2021  which  was to  ensure  all  customers'  feedback  or  complaints  (if  any) received via any delivery channel have been acknowledged and resolved promptly as per SFL's Feedback and Complaint Handling Process. We also achieved our target of ensuring that  all  call  back  requests  received  via  the  tablets  at  our customer centres are addressed in a timely manner. SFL aims

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

to  continue  to  maintain  this  performance  in  the  following year. By addressing the issues in a timely manner, we aim to maintain our Company's brand reputation and to improve on existing processes to meet our clients' needs more efficiently.

Moreover,  we  ensure  that  action  is  taken  after  receiving feedback, our Feedback and Complaint Handling Process has been set in place to enhance customers' experience with SFL. The  policy  contains  procedures  to  acknowledge  feedback, to  investigate  feedback  and  to  make  an  official  reply  to customers.  All  records  regarding  feedback  and  complaints will be filed with the RMD for further analysis and reference. The  RMD,  Communications  Department  and  Management are updated on this policy annually.

To  enhance  and  improve  on  the  quality  of  our  customer service, our Customer Centres receive on-the-job training by Branch Managers and case studies on customer service are shared timely among the Customer Centres.

The overall effect suggests providing feedback or a customer experience survey through a digital interface.



## Local Communities

[GRI 413-1]

SFL provides opportunities to engage our people in corporate social responsibility projects. Leveraging on their time and efforts, employees contribute meaningfully to the communities we live and work in. We believe that engaging with communities will help SFL to build a caring and giving culture, which will bring our people together and strengthen the community we live in.

In FY2019, SFL kicked off the new practice to better facilitate employee volunteerism. Our employees could apply for time off  to  volunteer  on  a  regular  basis  with  approved  charities and  social  enterprises.  In  FY2022,  due  to  various  ongoing work projects, SFL was unable to actively participate in local communities' assistance program and initiatives. For FY2023, SFL will continue to encourage employees to participate in voluntary community activities. In the long run, we hope to make this giving culture an intrinsic part of SFL and to help provide more positive impact as a Company.

## Occupational Health and Safety

[GRI 403-9, GRI 403-10]

In FY2021, we added Occupational Health and Safety as an additional  disclosure  (non-material  GRI  factor).  This  year, SFL  achieved  its  target  of  maintaining  zero  cases  of  workrelated  injuries  and  ill-health  (Table  9).  Going  forward,  we aim to continue maintaining a zero case in FY2023. This will be achieved through educating staff on the importance on safety  through  company  policies  on  workplace  health  and safety policies.

The  below  charts  show  that  we  have  zero  case  of  workrelated injuries and ill health in FY2022

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

## GOVERNANCE

## Socioeconomic Compliance

[GRI 3-3, GRI 2-27]

Trust is an important trait of a company. To maintain the trust of our stakeholders, SFL understands that it is important to be compliant with the relevant laws and regulations. Hence, we are committed to ensure that we conduct our business with utmost integrity and high standards of business ethics, in line with our core company values.

SFL is compliant with relevant laws and regulations by taking actions  through  the  compliance  department  team.  The team take steps to assess the implications of any updates of  regulations  and  report  to  Operational  &amp;  Technology Risk  Committee  ('OPTECH')  every  two  months  and  HODs quarterly.  They  are  also  responsible  for  communicating new  regulations  or  changes  to  existing  regulations  to  the relevant  HODs  within  three  working  days.  The  HODs  and Chief  Executive  Officer  ('CEO')  are  required  to  sign  off  a semi-annual Regulatory Requirements and Self-Assessment ('RRSA')  checklist.  To  stay  relevant,  SFL  ensures  that  our compliance department receives email alerts from MAS and other regulatory bodies for latest updates and disseminate the information to relevant departments within three working days.

Next,  we  have  in  place  a  Compliance  Risk  Management Framework. It consists of the objective for the management of  compliance  risk,  governance  and  oversight  structure, roles  and  responsibilities  as  well  as  the  compliance  risk management process. The purpose of this framework is to serve  as  a  guide  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  Management, Compliance Department, and all employees on the key areas to note when dealing with compliance risks.

We then perform a quarterly review of scripless shareholders to monitor any non-disclosure of shareholding or transactions by  our  employees.  An  internal  guideline  is  in  place,  which prohibits employees from dealing in the Company's securities during the period commencing one month before the date of announcement of half yearly and full year financial results. In 2022, all employees have complied with the guideline. In addition,  an  Enterprise-Wide  Risk  Assessment  ('EWRA')  for AML is conducted annually.

We  have  successfully  achieved  our  targeted  performance for FY2022 of zero cases of significant fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations  in  the  social  and  economic  area.  We  are  also pleased  to  announce  that  100%  of  our  employees  were proactive in attending trainings related to compliance, AML and CFT. We aim to maintain this good performance and to ensure that all employees attend compliance trainings in the following year.

## Anti-corruption

[GRI 3-3, GRI 205-2, GRI 205-3]

Corruption is a considerable obstacle to economic and social development of the Company and at SFL, we do not tolerate any forms of corruption. As a form of deterrence, we have taken  the  initiative  to  put  in  place  several  anti-corruption policies available on the Company's general online drive for all  employees  to  access.  These  include  HR  Policy,  Whistle Blowing  Policy,  Fraud  Policy,  Interested  Party  Transactions ('IPT') Policy, Related Party Transactions ('RPT') Policy as well as Policy and Guidelines on AML and CFT. These policies are reviewed regularly to ensure they are always up to date.

It  is  compulsory  for  new  joiners  to  attend  an  Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism ('AML/ CFT') training within six months of joining the Company.  New joiners are also required to read and familiarise themselves with the Fraud, Whistleblowing, Related Party and Interested party policies of the Company. In FY2022, a total number of 102  employees  (100%  of  eligible  employees)  attended  our AML/CFT training.

SFL also engages an external consultant every two years to train  all  staff  about  new  and  recent  developments in AML/ CFT to keep staff aware of the AML/CFT developments. SFL provides an alternative channel for whistle blowers to lodge a report of improper conduct in the Company on a confidential basis as well as guidance for establishing, implementing, and managing whistle blower protection programme.

In  FY2022,  we  have  achieved  our  goal  of  zero  incidents  of corruption, fraud, whistle blowing, improper interested party transactions or related party transactions, anti-money laundering  and  countering  the  financing  of  terrorism  that resulted  in  legal  action,  and  we  aim  to  continue  achieving this  goal  in  FY2023.  There  were  also  no  incidents  in  which employees  were  dismissed  or  disciplined  for  corruption and  zero  incidents  when  contracts  with  business  partners were terminated or not renewed due to violations related to corruption. In addition, we were not faced with any public legal cases regarding corruption brought against the Company or our employees during the reporting period. SFL maintained zero tolerance for knowingly breaching regulations on antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism and had zero incidents of knowingly on-boarding high risk customers without first performing the necessary enhanced due diligence measures.

We  plan  to  maintain  the  100%  attendance  rate  in  anticorruption  related  trainings  for  eligible  employees  as  well as  creating  awareness  on  the  repercussions  of  corruption through  our  regular  review  and  enhancement  of  anticorruption policies.

The profile of each Director, including professional qualifications, working experience, other directorships and principal commitments/appointments,  can  be  found  on  pages  4  to  6  of  this  Annual  Report.  The  Company  has  no  alternate director on its Board.

Under the Code, an independent director is one who is independent in conduct, character and judgment, and has no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers, that could interfere, or  be  reasonably  perceived  to  interfere,  with  the  exercise  of  the  director's  independent  business  judgement  in  the best interests of the Company. The NC annually reviews the independence of each Director by taking into account the definition of an independent Director and the relevant provisions and listing rules under the Code and the SGX-ST Listing Manual respectively.

The Independent Non-Executive Directors ('INEDs'), comprising majority of the Board, are able to exercise objective and independent judgment on matters of the Group. There is a strong independent element on the Board as at the date of this report.

Under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, a director will not be independent if he/she is employed by the company or any of its  related corporations for the current or any of the past three financial years, or, if he/she has any immediate family member who is employed or has been employed by the company or any of its related corporations for the past three financial years, and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee of the company.

The above provisions in the Code and the listing rules in the SGX-ST Listing Manual do not apply to any of the INEDs.

The NC takes into account the annual confirmation of independence completed by each INED. INEDs are required under the annual confirmation to critically assess their independence.

As non-executive members of the Board, the INEDs does not exercise management functions in the Company. However, all the Directors have equal responsibility and make contributions towards the performance of the Group.

Based on Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual which came into effect on 1 January 2022, a director who has  been  a  director  for  an  aggregate  period  of  more  than  9  years  (whether  commencing  before  or  after  listing)  is not independent if his/her continued appointment as an independent director has not been sought and approved in separate resolutions by (A) all shareholders; and (B) all shareholders, excluding shareholders who also serve as the directors or the chief executive officer of the company, and associates of such directors and chief executive officers ('Two-Tier  Voting')  such  resolutions  to  remain  in  force  until  the  earlier  of  retirement  or  resignation  of  the  above Directors; or the conclusion of the third annual general meeting ('AGM') of the Company following the passing of the resolution.

At the AGM held on 23 April 2021, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, who have served on Board beyond nine years from the date of their respective first appointments, have been re-appointed as independent Directors via the Two-Tier Voting in separate resolutions.

Following the removal of Two-Tier Voting mechanism, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng Martha will continue to be deemed independent until the Company's AGM held for the financial year ending 31 December 2023.

The Board has reviewed and assessed the independence of Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, (these Directors has each abstaining from deliberation on their continued appointment) using a holistic approach. The assessments take into account their respective contributions in terms of experience, expertise, professionalism, integrity, objectivity and independent judgement in their engagement with all relevant parties, rather than solely and arbitrarily on basis of length of service alone.

Having  performed  a  rigorous  review  of  their  independence,  the  NC  and  the  Board  are  of  the  view  that  these Directors continue to be independent notwithstanding their length of service. Each of these Directors has consistently demonstrated  strong  independence  of  judgment  and  integrity  of  character  in  discharging  his/  her  respective responsibilities.

All  the  INEDs are sitting in the respective Board Committees which require special skillset and experience and their contribution are still required at the Committees level. Their vast experience enables them to provide the Board and the various Board Committees which they serve, with pertinent experience and competence to facilitate sound decisionmaking. Their length of service does not in any way interfere with their exercise of independent judgement nor hinder their ability to act in the best interests of the Company.

The Board trust that they are able to continue to discharge their duties independently with integrity and competency. The Board considers its INEDs to be of significant influence and their views to be invaluable such that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the Board's decision-making processes.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Board Composition and Diversity (Provision 2.4)

The  Board,  assisted  by  the  NC,  reviews  the  Board  size  and  composition  regularly  to  ensure  its  appropriateness  in facilitating robust engagement and effective decision-making under the Group's current scope and nature of operations and business requirements.

## Board Diversity

The Company recognises the need and benefits of embracing diversity at the Board level to enhance stewardship and decision-making capabilities that commensurate with the ever-evolving operating environment.

To promote diversity of the Board, the Company has adopted the Board Diversity Policy, taking into consideration from a number of aspects, including but not limited to:

- (a) age;
- (b) gender;
- (c) nationalities;
- (d) ethnicity;
- (e) experience;
- (f) educational background;
- (g) skills;
- (h) knowledge;
- (i) length of service;
- (j) independence (if applicable); and
- (k) other relevant qualities considered essential for the effective governance of the Company.

These aspects will be considered in determining the optimum composition of the Board.

Guided by the Company's Board Diversity Policy, the NC is cognisant of achieving an appropriately balanced mix of talent on the Board, comprising Directors with diverse but complimentary backgrounds and experiences. Selection of candidates will be based on a range of diversity perspectives as mentioned above. The ultimate decision will be based on merit and contribution that the selected candidates will bring to the Board.

## Board Composition

The  current  members  of  the  Board  are  prominent  business  leaders  and  professionals  with  financial,  banking  and business management backgrounds. Their diverse corporate experiences as a group provide core competencies relevant to the Group's business, and an appropriate balance of skills, experience, gender and knowledge of the Company.

In  recognition  of  the  importance  and  value  of  gender  diversity,  the  Board  comprises  two  female  Directors,  which constitutes one quarter (25%) representation of the Board.

In addition, the Directors with ages ranging from mid-40s to more than 70 years old, who have served on the Board for different tenures, with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group's business and direction.

The Board, through the NC, has reviewed its composition, and is satisfied that the size of the Board is appropriate and adequate for effective decision-making having regard to its present scale of operations.

## Setting Targets, Plans and Timelines

The NC discuss and agree annually the relevant measurable targets for promoting and achieving diversity on the Board and make its recommendations for consideration and approval by the Board. The targets may involve at any given time, one or more aspects of board diversity with different timelines for achievement.

As part of its continuous effort in promoting diversity of the Board, the Company targeted to include a Board member with experience/background in technology industry by 2024. The Board will regularly engage individuals with the correct profile and assess their suitability to be appointed.

## Meeting of Independent Directors without Management (Provisions 2.5)

The  INEDs  constructively  challenge,  assist  with  development  of  strategic  proposals,  review  the  performance  of Management in meeting goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance.

The INEDs, led by the Lead Independent non-Executive Director ('LID'), Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon meet on a need basis without the presence of Management, in order to facilitate a more effective check on Management. The LID would provide  feedback  to  the  Executive  Chairman  after  such  meetings.  No  meeting  of  the  Independent  Directors  was convened in FY2022.

## Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Principle 3:  There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

(Chairperson)

## Role and Responsibilities of the NC (Provision 4.1)

Based on its TOR, the principal functions of the NC include:

- l reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board, taking into account, aspects of Board diversity, and making recommendations to the Board with regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary;
- l identifying and nominating for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when they arise;
- l determining annually, and if circumstances require, the independence of a Director;
- l reviewing the ability of a Director to adequately carry out his duties as Director when he has multiple board representations;
- l reviewing and recommending the nomination for re-appointment of Directors;
- l reviewing the succession planning of the Board and KMP.
- l assessing the effectiveness and performance of the Board, Board Committees and individual Directors;
- l reviewing and recommending relevant matters relating to Board diversity;
- l reviewing the training and professional development programs for the Board; and
- l reviewing its TOR to ensure alignment with the Code

None of the Directors has an alternate Director. As a Director is expected to be able to commit time to the affairs of the Company, the NC will generally not support the appointment of an alternate Director.

## Selection, appointment and re-appointment of Directors (Provision 4.3)

Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors

The NC reviews and assesses the Board composition and recommends the appointment of new Director(s) for the Board's consideration. In doing so, the NC will:

- (a) consider  the  range  of  diversity  aspects  in  particular,  skills,  knowledge,  experience  including  familiarity  in the Company's core markets, age, gender and length of service, and assess the combined factors against the requirements needed to govern and direct the Company's strategic objectives.
- (b) identify and nominate suitable candidates to the Board based on merit and independence, and against objective criteria while paying due regard to the need for diversity on the Board.

The  channels  used  in  searching  for  appropriate  candidates  would  include  third  party  search  firms  and  personal networks. Any search firm engaged to assist the Board or Board committees in identifying candidates for appointment to the Board will be specifically directed to include diverse candidates.

The NC identifies and interviews short-listed candidates before recommending them for appointment formally to the Board and where applicable, to the Board Committees.

In reviewing and recommending any new Director appointment, the NC takes into consideration the current Board size and its mix, the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple Board representations, the additional skills  and  experience that will bolster the core competencies of the Board, the search process for the identification of suitable candidates and once identified, the appropriate knowledge, experience and skills of the candidates who in its opinion, are fit and proper and qualified for office. As the Company is a finance company as defined under the Finance Companies Act 1967 of Singapore, in accordance with the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS') Notice 817, all new appointments to the Board are subject to the approval of the MAS.

The decision on selection of new Director(s) will be based on merit against objective criteria that complements and expands the skills and experience of the Board as a whole having considered the overall balance and effectiveness of a diverse Board.

## Re-appointment of Directors

Under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, all Directors are required to submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election at least once every three years. Article 97 of the Constitution requires one-third of the Directors, or the number nearest to but not less than one-third, to retire by rotation at every AGM. These Directors may offer themselves for re-election, if eligible.

The  NC  reviews  annually  the  nomination  of  the  relevant  Directors  for  re-election  or  re-appointments  as  well  the independence of Directors. When considering the nomination of Directors for re-appointment, the NC takes into account their contribution to the effectiveness of the Board as well as their time commitment especially for Directors who have multiple board representations, and also reviews their independence.

The NC had recommended to the Board that Mr Teo Chiang Long, Mr William Ho Ah Seng and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang (the 'Retiring Directors') retire pursuant to Article 97 of the Constitution and be nominated for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. The Board had accepted the NC's recommendations.

The Retiring Directors had consented to act and offered themselves for re-election. Each of the Retiring Directors had abstained from the discussion and recused from voting in respect of his/her own nomination.

Pursuant to Rule 720(6) of the Listing Manual, detailed information of the Directors who are proposed to be re-elected to the Board is set out at pages 131 to 138 of this Annual Report.

## Succession Planning for the Board, the Board Chairman and Senior Management

The Board believes in carrying out succession planning for itself, the Board Chairman and the Senior Management team to ensure continuity of leadership. Board renewal is a continuing process.

The NC reviews annually the composition of the Board and Committees and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment of new Directors, whether in addition to the existing Board members or as replacement of retiring Board members, with a view to identifying any gaps in the Board's skills set taking into account the Group's business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding any resignation or retirement of any Director given the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board.

## Directors' other directorships and principal commitments (Provision 4.5)

Where a Director has multiple Board representations, the NC also considers if such a Director is able to adequately carry out his/her responsibilities as a Director of the Company.

The Board has set a general guideline that the maximum number of listed company board representations which a Director  may  hold  (including  representation  on  the  Company's  Board)  should  not  be  more  than  seven.  These guidelines were established following the careful assessment by the NC and the Board after taking into consideration the scope and complexity of the Company's business. Where there is a potential conflict of interest in accepting a new appointment on the board of other listed companies, assessment through the NC and the approval of the Board are required prior to accepting that appointment.

All Directors have met the requirements under the guidelines. The Board is satisfied that each Director has committed sufficient time to the Company and has contributed meaningfully to the Company. Details of the Directors' professional qualifications, working experience, and other directorships and principal commitments/appointments can be found on pages 4 to 6.

## Determining Directors' Independence (Provision 4.4)

The  NC  is  also  responsible  for  determining  annually,  and  as  and  when  circumstances  arise,  the  independence  of Directors.

On an annual basis, each ID is required to complete a declaration of independence based on the provisions in the Code and the Listing Rules, for the NC's review. The NC takes into account the principles and guidelines set out in the Code and the Listing Rules and assessed the independence of Directors based on the following considerations:

- (a) whether the Director has a relationship with the Company or its related corporations, substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere with the exercise of his/her independent judgement in the best interests of the Company;
- (b) whether the Director is or has been employed by the Company or any of its related corporations in the current or immediate past financial years;
- (c) whether the Director has an immediate family member who is or has been employed by the Company or any of its related corporations in the current or any of the past three financial years, and whose remuneration is or was determined by the RC;
- (d) whether the Director or his/her immediate family member has, in the current or immediate past financial year, provided to or received from the Company or any of its subsidiaries any significant payments or material services, other than compensation for Board service;
- (e) whether the Director or his/her immediate family member, in the current or immediate past financial year, is or was, a substantial shareholder or a partner in (with 5% or more stake), or an executive officer of, or a director of,  any  organisation which provided to or received from the Company or any of its subsidiaries any significant payments or material services;
- (f) whether the Director has been a Director on the Board for an aggregate period of more than nine years; and
- (g) any other applicable circumstances.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The  NC  has  reviewed  and  ascertained  that  the  INEDs  continue  to  remain  independent  having  considered  their confirmation that they do not have any relationship with the Company, its related companies, substantial shareholders, or officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Directors' independent business judgement with a view to the best interests of the Company and the Group, and the other considerations set out above.

## Board Performance

Principle 5:  The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

Assessing the effectiveness of the Board, Board Committees and Individual Directors (Provisions 5.1 and 5.2) The Company has in place a formal process for assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the Board Committees and the contribution by each Director to the effectiveness of the Board.

The  NC  assesses  the  Board's  performance  as  a  whole  annually  using  objective  and  appropriate  quantitative  and qualitative  criteria  and  approved  by  the  Board.  When  assessing  the  overall  Board  performance,  the  NC  takes  into consideration the feedback from individual Directors on areas relating to the Board's competencies and effectiveness. The results of  the  overall  evaluation  including  its  recommendations  for  improvements,  if  any,  are  presented  to  the Board.

The  NC  assesses  the  performance  of  all  the  Board  Committees  with  the  assistance  of  self-assessment  checklists completed by each of the Board Committees.

The annual evaluation process for each individual Director's performance comprises three parts:

- (a) background  information  concerning  the  Director  including  his/her  attendance  records  at  Board  and  Board Committee meetings;
- (b) questionnaire for completion by each individual Board member; and
- (c) the NC's evaluation based on certain assessment parameters.

The questionnaires and the assessment parameters were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. The completed questionnaires are then reviewed by the NC before the NC completes its evaluation of the individual Directors.

The results of the individual evaluation of each of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Board Chairman, to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Board Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the re-appointment and re-election of retiring Directors. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board.

## Board Evaluation Criteria

The qualitative criteria are set out in a questionnaire covering three main areas relating to Board composition, roles and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information.

The  quantitative  criteria  used  to  evaluate  the  overall  Board  performance  comprises  performance  indicators  which include a comparison of the Company's performance for the financial period under review against the performance of the Company and industry peers for the corresponding period over the past five years and the longer-term indicators such as the Company's total shareholder return over a five-year period.

## Board Committee Evaluation Criteria

The qualitative criteria are set out in a questionnaire covering areas relating to composition of the Board Committee, its roles and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information.

## Individual Director Evaluation Criteria

Factors taken into account in the assessment of a Director's performance include his abilities and competencies, his objectivity and the level of participation at Board and Board Committee meetings including his contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Company.

## REMUNERATION MATTERS

## Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies

Principle 6:  The Board has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors and key management personnel. No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

## Composition of the RC (Provision 6.2)

The RC comprises the following six members, all of whom are INEDs:

Mr Teoh Eng Hong (Chairman) Mr William Ho Ah Seng Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha Mr Adam Tan Chin Han Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang.

## Role and responsibilities of the RC (Provision 6.1)

Based on the TOR approved by the Board, the principal functions of the RC are:

- l reviewing  and  recommending to the Board a framework of remuneration policies for Directors and KMP as defined in the Code;
- l reviewing and recommending to the Board the specific remuneration packages and terms of employment of each Director and KMP, covering all aspects of remuneration including but not limited to Directors' fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options and benefits-in-kind;
- l reviewing  and  recommending  to  the  Board  the  setting  up  of  share  option  schemes  or  long-term  incentive schemes;
- l reviewing the Group's remuneration and benefits policies and practices, including any share plans and/or other long-term incentive schemes;
- l proposing, for adoption by the Board, measurable, appropriate and meaningful performance criteria to assist in the evaluation of the performance of KMP, individual Directors and of the Board as a whole; and
- l reviewing the obligations of the Group arising in the event of the termination of the contracts of service of EDs and KMP to ensure that such contracts of service contain fair and reasonable termination clauses which are not overly generous.

## Remuneration Framework (Provision 6.3)

There  is  a  formal  and  transparent  process  for  developing  executive  remuneration  and  for  determining  the remuneration packages of individual Directors. No Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration. The RC's recommendations are submitted for endorsement by the Board.

The RC reviews all matters concerning the remuneration of the INEDs to ensure that remuneration commensurate with their contributions, responsibilities and market benchmarks.

None of the INEDs has service contracts or consultancy arrangements with the Company. They are paid Directors' fees based on a structured fee framework reflecting the responsibilities and time commitment of each Director.

The  annual  quantum  of  Directors'  fees  to  be  paid  is  reviewed  by  the  RC  and  the  Board  before  submission  to shareholders for approval at the Company's AGM.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The remuneration packages of executive Directors and KMP are approved by the Board upon recommendations by the RC. The Executive Chairman and the CEO do not participate in discussion of their compensation packages. The two executive Directors and all KMP are on service contracts with fixed appointment periods. The RC reviews the service contracts of executive directors and KMP to ensure that they do not contain onerous removal clauses.

There are no contractual provisions to allow the Company to reclaim incentive components of remuneration from the executive Directors and KMP in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial statements, or of misconduct resulting  in  financial  loss  to  the  Company.  The  RC  is  of  the  view  that  such  claw  back  provisions  are  not  necessary because the variable components of their remuneration packages are moderate.

## RC access to expert professional advice (Provision 6.4)

The RC may from time to time seek expert advice from external consultants whenever required. No external consultant was engaged in FY2022 to provide remuneration advice.

## Level and Mix of Remuneration

Principle 7:  The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and key management personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the company, taking into account the strategic objectives of the company.

## Remuneration Policy of Directors and Key Management Personnel ('KMP') (Provisions 7.1 to 7.3)

The Group's remuneration policy aims to provide compensation packages at market rates which reward successful performance and attract, retain and motivate Directors and KPM.

## Fixed and Variable Components

The compensation packages for executive Directors and KMP comprise a fixed component (in the form of a base salary and fixed allowances) and a variable component (comprising short-term incentives in the form of year-end and variable bonuses and benefits-in-kind, where applicable). The variable components take into account, amongst other factors, the executive Directors' and KMP's performance, and the Company's performance and industry practices.

In  determining  the  variable  incentives  for  an  executive  Director  and  a  KMP,  his/her  individual  performance  and contribution  is  taken  into  consideration  together  with  the  competitive  market  practices  and  information  gathered from market surveys conducted by the Company's Human Resources department. This is then reviewed along with the Company's performance, taking into consideration specific indicators tracked over time which align with shareholders' interest, risk policies of the Company which promote the long-term success of the Company. Besides profitability, the quality of the Company's core business is also taken into account with the monitoring of the size and robustness of its  loan assets and the level of non-performing loans.  Based on its assessment, the RC believes that the performance conditions used in determining the variable components of executive Director and KMP have been met.

## Directors' Fees

Both executive and non-executive Directors receive Directors' fees which are subject to approval by shareholders. When reviewing the structure and level of Directors' fees, the RC takes into consideration the Directors' respective roles and responsibilities in the Board and Board Committees, effort and time spent, and changes in the business, corporate governance practices and regulatory rules.

The  RC  also  compares  the  Company's  fee  structure  against  industry  practices  and  ensures  that  the  non-executive Directors are not over-compensated to the extent that their independence may be compromised.

Other factors taken into consideration in the fee review includes frequency of Board and Board Committee meetings, corporate performance for the financial year under review as well as the corporate and economic outlook in the new financial year, and the interval since the last fee review. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.

There are no schemes to encourage non-executive Directors to hold shares in the company so as to better align the interests of such non-executive Directors with the interests of shareholders. However, the Company does not discourage the Directors from holding shares in the Company.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The RC has recommended that the Board tables for shareholders' approval at the AGM, the payment Directors' fees of S$480,000 for FY2022.

No member of the RC is involved in deliberating and deciding on his/her remuneration, compensation or any other form of benefits. The Board concurred with the RC that the proposed Directors' Fees for FY2022 are appropriate and not excessive, taking into consideration the level of contributions by the Directors, the effort and time spent serving on the Board and Board Committees as well as the responsibilities and obligations associated with their duties as Directors. The recommendations would be tabled at the forthcoming AGM for shareholders' approval.

## Long-term Incentive Scheme

Staff retirement gratuity is the only long-term incentive scheme of the Company. Staff (including executive Director and KMP) who are employed before 28 December 2002 are entitled to the staff retirement gratuity if they have worked for at least 12 continuous years prior to retirement. The Company does not offer shares or grant options with vesting period or employees share scheme to its Directors and staff.

## Disclosure on Remuneration

Principle  8:    The  company  is  transparent  on  its  remuneration  policies,  level  and  mix  of  remuneration,  the procedure  for  setting  remuneration,  and  the  relationships  between  remuneration,  performance  and  value creation.

The Code recommends that the Company should fully disclose the remuneration of each individual Director and the CEO on a named basis. The Board is of the view that such disclosure would not be in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders.

Taking into account the details disclosed in the table above as well as note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements which  provides  an  appropriate  balance  between  detailed  disclosure  and  confidentiality  in  the  sensitive  area  of remuneration, the Board is of the view there is sufficient transparency and information on the remuneration policies, level  and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation which are consistent with the intent of Principle 8 of the Code. In arriving at its decision, the Board also took into consideration the competitive business environment in which the Group operates, and the negative impact such disclosure may have on the Group.

## Remuneration of Key Management Personnel (not being a Director or CEO)

The Code recommends that the Company should name and disclose the remuneration of at least the top five KMP (who are not Directors or the CEO) in bands of $250,000/-. In addition, the Company should also disclose in aggregate the total remuneration paid to these KMP. As the Company only has two KMP, the Board is of the view that disclosure of the total remuneration of the KMP would be disadvantageous to the Group's business interests, given the prevailing highly competitive industry conditions. The remuneration of one of the KMP in the Company is below $250,000/- while the other is between $250,000 and $500,000. Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements provides an appropriate balance between detailed disclosure and confidentiality in the sensitive area of remuneration.

## Remuneration of Immediate Family Member of a Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder (Provision 8.2)

The  Code  also  recommends  disclosure  of  the  name  and  remuneration  of  employees  who  are  immediate  family members of a Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder of the Company, whose remuneration exceeds $100,000/during the year, in bands $100,000/-. Excluding the two executive Directors, there were no employees of the Group who are immediate family members of a Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder and whose remuneration exceeded $100,000/- during the financial year.

## ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

## Risk Management and Internal Controls

Principle 9:  The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

## Design, Implementation and Monitoring of Risk Management and Internal Control Systems (Provision 9.1) Accountability of Board and Management

The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility to ensure accurate financial reporting for the Group.

The Board provides shareholders with semi-annual and annual financial results. In presenting these statements, the Board aims to provide shareholders with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance and position with a commentary at the date of announcement of the competitive conditions within the industry in which it operates.

Management provides all Directors periodically with accounts and reports on the Group's financial performance and commentaries on the competitive conditions within the industry in which the Group operates, which are reviewed by the AC and Board at its meetings prior to release of the announcements on the Group's semi-annual and full-year results. Periodic reports covering the Group's financial performance are also provided to all Directors. Apart from the periodic updates provided by Management, the Directors may at any time seek further information from, and discuss with, Management on the Group's operations and performance.

## Separate Risk Management Committee

The Board is fully committed to the implementation of sound risk management policies and practices, which are aligned to the Group's overall business strategy and objectives. The Board determines the type and level of business risks that the Group undertakes. Annually, the Board, assisted by the RMC, reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls.

The RMC assists the Board in overseeing risk governance in the Group's business and operations and ensuring that Management maintains a robust risk management framework with strong internal controls to safeguard shareholders' interests and the Group's assets.

The RMC comprises the following six members:

Mr Adam Tan Chin Han (Chairman) Mr Teoh Eng Hong Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha Mr William Ho Ah Seng Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang Mr Jamie Teo Miang Yeow

## Roles and Responsibilities of RMC

Based on its TOR, the principal functions of the RMC include:

- l reviewing  and  submitting  for  Board  approval  the  Group's  overall  risk  management  framework,  policies, procedures and limits and any changes thereof.
- l reviewing and guiding Management in the formulation of the Group's risk policies and in the execution of risk assessment processes and mitigation strategies.
- l monitoring and managing the risk exposures of the Group.
- l reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's risk management system.
- l reviewing and ensuring that the proposed annual budget is aligned with the Company's objectives and strategy and is consistent with the Company's risk tolerance and risk profile prior to recommending to the Board for further deliberation and approval.

The RMC has, in turn, appointed the Credit Control Committee, Credit Portfolio Committee, Asset-Liability Committee and Operational &amp; Technology Risk Committee to assist in fulfilling its roles.

## Risk management and internal control systems

The key risks of the Group include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational and technology risk and compliance risk.  Risk  management  is  an  ongoing  process.  Continuous  efforts  are  being  made  to  ensure  that  the  Group's  risk management system and processes are in line with industry best practices.

## Credit Risk

Counter-party risk or Credit risk is the risk arising from the uncertainty of an obligor's ability to perform its contractual obligations. The Group's credit risk primarily stems from lending activities.

The two management committees assisting in the management of credit risk are the Credit Control Committee and Credit Portfolio Committee.

The Credit Control Committee ('CCC') reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions.

The Credit Portfolio Committee ('CPC') manages risk on a portfolio-wide basis and recommends alternative portfolio strategies, analyses the results of portfolio management actions, and develops portfolio limits for each portfolio segment for approval by the RMC. The CPC recommends the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, credit risk policies and manuals for approval by the RMC.

Risk parameters for accepting credit risk are clearly defined and are supported by written policies and processes in the Lending Guidelines to ensure that the Group maintains a well-diversified and high-quality loan portfolio.

The credit control functions ensure that credit risks are closely monitored and managed in compliance with the Group's credit policies and guidelines.

Credit reviews are carried out regularly to proactively identify and address potential weakness in the credit process and to pre-empt any unexpected deterioration in credit quality.

Credit  stress  tests  framework  is  in  place  to  analyse  the  impact  of  plausible  adverse  scenarios  on  the  Group's  loan portfolio.

The Group addresses credit concentration risk by setting and monitoring credit portfolio and industry mix limits on a regular basis.

Continuous efforts are being made to further enhance the Group's credit risk management processes.

The  SFRS(I)  9  Committee  ('SC')  supports  the  Board  and  the  AC  in  achieving  compliance  with  Singapore  Financial Reporting Standards (International) 9 Financial Instruments ('SFRS(I)9') which came into effect from 1 January 2018. SFRS(I) 9 requires, amongst others, an expected credit loss ('ECL') model for calculating impairment of financial assets.

The SC works closely with CPC and CCC to ensure that the Group has appropriate credit risk practices, including an effective  system  of  internal  control,  to  consistently  determine  adequate  allowances  in  accordance  with  the  Group's policies and procedures relating to impairment allowances and applicable accounting framework under SFRS(I)9. The SC also reviews and recommends updates to the Governance &amp; Control Framework of ECL Model as well as the Impairment Allowance Policy at least on an annual basis. Any material changes to the ECL framework, methodology and policies are reviewed by SC before recommendation to the AC for concurrence and approval.

## Environmental Risk

Environmental risk issues, in particular climate change have become a major global challenge and urgently require a coordinated global response. In Singapore, there is a growing momentum to build a financial landscape which is conducive to achieve environmentally sustainable growth while contributing to the global efforts to transition to a low-carbon, climate resilience economy.

In  December 2020, the MAS issued a set of environmental risk management guidelines for the financial sector with the aim to enhance the sector's resilience to and management of environmental risk through the setting of sound risk management practices, including governance &amp; strategy and disclosure of environment risk information.

Financial  institutions  are  encouraged  to  integrate  environmental  risks  into  their  business  and  investment  decisions and disclose meaningful information that would enable its stakeholders to evaluate their performance in addressing environmental issues as a risk and an opportunity.

While  the  scale,  scope  and  business  models  of  financial  institutions  can  differ  vastly,  MAS  expects  approaches  to managing and disclosing environmental risk to mature as the methodologies for assessing, monitoring and reporting such risk evolve.

In  its  support  to  align  its  corporate  philosophy,  strategy  and  goals  to  the  government's vision of green finance, the Company has in place a framework for its environmental risk management. The underlying structure of the framework will recognise that environmental risk poses potential financial and reputational impact to the Company in the form of:

- l Credit risk - adverse climate change can impair the value of assets held by our customers, or impact supply chains affecting our customers' operations and profitability, and potentially, their viability.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

- l Market risk - the Company may be exposed to a decline in valuation and increased volatility in its investments, particularly to sectors which contribute to significant environmental degradation as a result of shifts in investor preferences.
- l Liquidity risk - a surge in funds withdrawal and demand for emergency loans due to frequent natural disasters which can cause widespread damage to physical property and incur significant costs like constructions and repair costs. Environmentally-conscious depositors may also cut back on sources of funding if they perceive that the Company finance activities with a negative impact on the environment.
- l Operational risk - extreme weather events can disrupt business continuity by negatively impacting the Company's infrastructure, systems, processes and staff.
- l Reputational risk - negative perception of the Company can arise in financing customers that carry on business activities  which  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  environment,  affecting  the  Company's  ability  to  maintain  or establish business relationships.

## Market Risk

Market risk encompasses price and interest rate risk, which are inherent in the ordinary course of the Group's business. Market risk refers to the risk to the Group resulting from movements in market prices, in particular, changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity prices.

The Asset-Liability Committee ('ALCO') manages the balance sheet to achieve an optimal balance between risk and reward with regards to structural interest rate risk, and liquidity and funding risk. ALCO also oversees the investment portfolio of the Company, reviews and recommends the limits of the Company's investments for approval by RMC as well as approves policies and strategies regarding these investments.

The Group has a comprehensive set of policies and monitoring system in place for the management of market risk. This includes limits for funding, maturity, and re-pricing gaps between assets and liabilities. An additional measure used by the Group for the interest rate sensitive investments is Present Value of a Basis Point ('PV01'), which measures the change in value of the interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a parallel increase of one basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve.

The  Company's  investment  portfolio  mainly  consists  of  Singapore  Government  Securities  and  MAS  Bills  for  the maintenance of regulatory minimum liquid assets purposes.

The  Group  uses  an  Asset  Liability  Management  System  to  enhance  its  capabilities  for  balance  sheet  and  liquidity simulation; and scenario analysis. Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis can now be performed under various interest rate scenarios using simulation modelling.

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity  risk  refers  to  the  risk  of  the  Group  being  unable  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  as  they  fall  due  without incurring unacceptable costs or losses through fund raising and assets liquidation. It could be a result of the inability of  the  Group to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources and the failure to recognise or address changes in market conditions that affect the institution's ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. The Group maintains sufficient liquidity to fund its day-to-day operations, including customers' demands for loan drawdowns, as well as any unanticipated cash withdrawals.

The Group has a comprehensive monitoring system in place for the management of liquidity risk. This includes limits for funding &amp; liquidity gaps, deposit analysis and minimum liquid asset ratio.

Liquidity policies, procedures and limits are in place to ensure effective liquidity risk management and compliance with all regulatory requirements.

A robust liquidity stress test framework is in place to assess and plan for the impact of various scenarios which may put the Company's liquidity at risk.

The ALCO manages the liquidity and funding risk to determine the appropriate levels of liquidity and ensures that funding costs are managed effectively, and reviews stress tests &amp; contingency funding plans for liquidity crises situations.

## Operational and Technology Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Technology risk is any risk related to information technology and information security.

The  Operational  and  Technology  Risk  Committee  ('OPTECH')  supports  the  RMC  in  its  handling  of  operational  and technology risk. The OPTECH recommends the operational and technology risk management framework, policies and procedures, and strategies to mitigate risks and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation risk processes and information flows.

To  pro-actively  manage  operational  risk,  each  department  undertakes  regular  operational  risk  and  control  selfassessments which involve identifying and assessing inherent risks, as well as assessing the effectiveness of controls to mitigate the identified risks. Where necessary, action plans are formulated based on the severity of the assessed residual risk after considering the mitigating controls. In addition, the Internal Audit function provides the assurance by conducting audits to assess the effectiveness of internal controls and report it to Management and the AC.

The  OPTECH  oversees  the  overall  outsourcing  function  for  the  Company  and  ensures  the  risk  management  of outsourcing arrangements is in compliance with MAS Guidelines on Outsourcing, especially for material outsourcing arrangements

All departments regularly review its own Business Impact Analysis and Disaster Recovery Plan and Management provides an attestation to the RMC on the state of readiness for the Company's business continuity management process, extent of alignment to MAS guidelines and declaration of residual risk.

Technology  risk  is  managed  in  accordance  with  a  Technology  Risk  Management  Framework  (which  covers  risk governance,  identification,  monitoring,  assessment,  mitigation  and  reporting),  supported  by  a  set  of  information technology policies and standards, control processes and risk mitigation programs in alignment to MAS guidelines.

## Compliance risk

Compliance risk is the risk of impairment to the Group's ability to successfully conduct its business as a result of any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. The Compliance Department is responsible for the Group's satisfactory compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and internal policies, including applicable rules and policies on anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism.

The Compliance Department is an independent function within the organisation which provides support such as carrying out independent checks upon implementation of new or changes in policies and procedures, as well as providing advice on regulatory requirements to relevant departments.

## Internal controls

The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for the Group's system of internal controls.

The  Company's  external  auditors  carry  out  in  the  course  of  their  statutory  audit,  a  review  of  the  effectiveness  of the Company's material internal controls focusing primarily on financial controls, to the extent set out in their audit plan. Material non-compliance and internal control weaknesses noted during their audit, and the external auditors' recommendation to address such non-compliance and weaknesses, are reported to the AC. Management, with the assistance of the internal auditors, follows up on external auditors' recommendations as part of its role in the review of the Company's internal control systems.

Besides that, all business units perform self-assessment of their processes to evaluate and manage the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal controls, as well as their level of compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The results of the evaluations are reviewed by Management.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Written assurances on their adequacy and effectiveness (Provision 9.2)

The  Board  has  received  assurances  from  the  CEO,  the  Financial  Controller  ('FC'),  KMP  and  Heads  of  Department regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The Board has also received assurance from the CEO and the FC that as at 31 December 2022, the Group's financial records have been properly maintained, and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances.

Based on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by Management and various Board Committees and the assurances received from the CEO, FC, KMP and Heads of Department, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC and the RMC, is of the opinion that the Group's system of internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, and risk management systems were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2022 to address the risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations. No material weaknesses in the Company's internal controls and risk management systems were identified by the Board, the AC and the RMC in FY2022. Accordingly, the Company has complied with Listing Rule 1207(10).

The Board notes that the system of internal controls provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.

## Audit Committee

## AC Composition (Provision 10.2)

The AC comprises the following six INEDs:

Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha (Chairman) Mr Teoh Eng Hong Mr William Ho Ah Seng Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon Mr Adam Tan Chin Han Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang

The Board considers that all the AC members, including the AC Chairman, have recent and relevant accounting or related financial management expertise or experience to discharge their duties as an AC member.

## External Audit

KPMG LLP is the external auditor of the Company. The external auditor provides regular updates and briefings to the AC on changes to accounting standards and other financial issues to enable the AC to keep abreast of such changes and its corresponding impact on the financial statements, if any. AC members are encouraged to attend seminars on updates to Financial Reporting Standards ('FRS'), when required.

In the review of the financial statements, the AC discussed with Management the accounting principles that were applied and their judgement of items that might affect the integrity of the financial statements. The AC also considered the clarity  of  disclosures on significant matters in the financial statements. Among other matters, the following key audit matters (KAMs) as reported by the external auditors for FY2022 on pages 63 to 64 were reviewed and discussed by the AC with Management and the external auditors:

| KAMs                                           | How the AC reviewed these matters and what decisions were made                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Allowance for impairment on loans and advances | The SFRS(I)9 Committee ('SC') as disclosed under 'Credit Risk' on pages 48 to 49, supports the AC and the Board of the Group in achieving compliance with SFRS(I) 9. The AC has reviewed the Group's ECL Model Governance and Framework and the Impairment Allowance Policy. The AC was satisfied with the governing procedures and controls that have been put in place. The AC has also discussed with the external auditors and was satisfied that the underlying assumptions and methodologies were reasonable and fulfilled the requirements of SFRS(I)9 based on the model validation performed by the external auditors. The AC has discussed with Management and the external auditors and was satisfied that the overall loan impairment allowances were reasonable and fair and has taken into consideration the uncertain economic outlook with the post-model adjustments (PMAs). PMAs are short-term adjustments to the ECL balance as part of the year-end reporting process to reflect possible model limitations. The PMAs are sensitive to judgments and assumptions made regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how such scenarios are incorporated in the calculations. |

## Independence of EA

Having reviewed the nature and extent of the non-audit services provided to the Group by KPMG LLP, the AC is of the opinion that the provision of such non-audit services did not affect the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. For details of the fees paid to the external auditors in respect of audit and non-audit services during FY2022, please refer to note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

The  AC  is  satisfied  that  the  external  auditors  has  the  requisite  expertise  and  resources  to  perform  their  duties. Accordingly, the AC has nominated KPMG LLP for re-appointment as the external auditors at the forthcoming AGM. KPMG LLP have confirmed that it is registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. The Company is  thus  in  compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of the Group's auditors.

## Internal Audit (Provision 10.4)

The Group has a well-established internal audit function with formal procedures for the internal auditors to report their audit findings directly to the AC.

The annual internal audit plan is prepared in consultation with, but independent of Management, and submitted to the AC for approval. The AC ensures that the internal audit function has appropriate standing within the Company. The internal auditors report directly to the AC on audit issues and the CEO on administrative matters. The findings and recommendations made by the internal auditors have been adequately followed through and implemented by Management in the financial year. The AC participates in and approves the hiring, removal, evaluation and compensation of  the  internal  audit  function.  The  internal  auditors  are  given  unfettered  access  to  all  company  documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the AC.

Staffed by suitably qualified executives with relevant qualifications and experience, the primary role of the internal audit function is to assist the Board to evaluate the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls and risk management processes of the Company. The AC reviews the adequacy of the internal audit function through a review of  the  internal  auditor's  programmes on a quarterly basis and ensures that the internal audit function has adequate resources and appropriate authority to perform its functions properly. In doing so, the AC takes into consideration the service level, attentiveness, professionalism and calibre of the assigned personnel who carried out the internal audit activities during the financial year. The AC is also responsible for approving the appointment, remuneration, evaluation, resignation or dismissal of the Head of Internal Audit Department.

In  carrying out its function, our internal auditors are guided by the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by The Institute of Internal Auditors.

The  AC  has  appointed  Ernst  &amp;  Young  LLP  (Singapore)  to  perform  the  internal  audit  functions  for  the  Information Technology Services Department of the Group.

Based on its assessment, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the internal audit function was independent, effective and adequately resourced during FY2022.

The  Group  has  a  separate  compliance  function  to  help  ensure  adherence  with  applicable  legislation,  rules  and regulations in the conduct of its business.

## Meeting with external auditors and internal auditors (Provision 10.5)

The  AC  meets  with  the  external  and  internal  auditors  without  the  presence  of  Management  at  least  twice  during the  year.  The  AC  has  explicit  authority  to  investigate  any  matter  within  its  TOR,  full  access  to  and  co-operation  of Management and the internal auditors and has full discretion to invite any Director or executive officer to attend its meetings.  The auditors, both internal and external, have unrestricted access to the AC.

Both the internal auditors and external auditors have confirmed that they had access to and received full co-operation and assistance from Management and no restrictions were placed on the scope of their audit.

## Whistleblowing Policy

The Company has in place a whistleblowing policy which sets out procedures that employees of the Group may raise in confidence, any concerns on suspected breach or fraud, or possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or behaviour that may not be in compliance with the law and Code of Conduct of the Company, without fear of reprisals. The whistleblowing policy is reviewed by the AC and approved by the Board annually to ensure that it remains current and relevant. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken.

The whistleblowing policy is accessible to all employees via the Company's shared drive. Employees may report via the  dedicated  whistleblowing  communication channel to the AC Chairman. The Company has designated the AC to investigate whistleblowing reports made in good faith independently. The Company will treat all (written) complaints in  a  confidential and sensitive manner. A report of a complaint will only be disclosed to persons on a need to know basis  in  order  to  properly  carry  out  an  investigation  and  the  identity  of  the  whistleblower  is  kept  confidential.  The Company is committed to ensure protection of the whistleblower against detrimental or unfair treatment arising from whistleblowing. The AC is responsible for oversight and monitoring of whistleblowing.

There was no whistleblowing incident during FY2022.

## Interested Person Transactions

The Company has established policies and procedures on related party and interested persons transactions to ensure that  such  transactions  are  undertaken  on  an  arm's  length  basis,  on  normal  commercial  terms  consistent  with  the Company's usual business practices and policies, and are not prejudicial to the interest of the Company and its minority shareholders. The AC reviews all related party and interested person transactions on a quarterly basis.

The interested person transactions and the aggregate value of interested person transactions disclosed as required under Rule 907 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual during FY2022 are as follows:

| Name of Interested Person   | Aggregate value of all interested person transactions during the financial year under review (excluding transactions less than $100,000 and transactions conducted under shareholders' mandate pursuant to Rule 920)   | Aggregate value of all interested person transactions conducted under shareholders' mandate pursuant to Rule 920 (excluding transactions less than $100,000)   |

The transaction above was carried out on normal commercial terms which are not prejudicial to the interest of the Company and its minority shareholders.

## Material Contracts

Save for the tenancy agreement entered into by the Company with High Luck Pte Ltd as disclosed in the preceding section entitled 'Interested Person Transactions', there were no other material contracts entered into by the Group involving the interest of the CEO, any Director, or controlling shareholder, which are either still subsisting at the end of FY2022 or if not then subsisting, entered into since the end of the previous financial year.

## Report on the audit of the financial statements

## Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Singapura Finance Ltd  ('the Company') and its subsidiaries ('the Group'), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet of the Group and the balance sheet of the Company as at 31 December 2022, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement of the Group and the statement of changes in equity of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 67 to 123.

In  our  opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  and  the  balance  sheet  and statement  of  changes  in  equity  of  the  Company  are  properly  drawn  up  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Companies Act 1967 ('the Act') and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) ('SFRS(I)s') so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2022 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing ('SSAs').  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements '  section  of  our report.  We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of  Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities ('ACRA  Code')  together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period.  These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

| Allowance for ECL is viewed as a key audit matter as a result of the significance of the loans and advances to customers and inherent complexity in the Group's ECL model. The Group's loans and advances to customers represent 72% of its total assets. Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases: (i) 12-month ECLs for financial assets where credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk ('Stage 1 ECLs'); or (ii) Lifetime ECLs for financial assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition ('Stage 2 ECLs') or are credit impaired ('Stage 3 ECLs'). Judgement is required in the following areas including: l appropriateness of the methodology and parameters used in the ECL model; l identification of credit exposures which have exhibited a 'significant increase in credit risk' and l determination of relevant macroeconomic factors for incorporation into the model. In 2022, the Group refreshed their ECL model by further segmenting their loan portfolio into more granular portfolio profiles. As the uncertain economic outlook continues to pose challenges and complexities to the adequacy of the ECL recorded, the Group exercised their judgment in assessing the reasonableness and validity of post-model adjustments including economic scenarios to be applied, to address possible model limitations. | We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the key controls in place over the credit approval and review processes. We performed sample checks of credit reviews on loans and advances to critically assess the appropriateness of the credit grading and any objective evidence of impairment. We also considered the appropriateness of the criteria designed by management to identify significant increase in credit risk, considering the impacts of an certain economic outlook. For credit impaired exposures, we assessed the reasonableness of management estimates of expected future cashflows, including the realisable value of collaterals if relevant. For non-credit impaired exposures, we reviewed the appropriateness of the ECL methodology and management's assumptions on the parameters used in the ECL model, including segmentation of the loan portfolio, probability of default term structure, loss given default, exposure at default and macroeconomic factors. We also tested the accuracy of key data inputs into the ECL models for a sample of exposures as at year-end by checking them against source systems and documents. We independently re-calculated the ECL allowance for a sample of credit exposures to test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations produced by the ECL model. In response to the uncertain economic outlook, we assessed the reasonableness of the post-model adjustments applied by management. In addition, we considered the adequacy of disclosures of these key assumptions in the financial statements. Based on our procedures performed, the methodology, assumptions and data adopted by management in the ECL model were considered acceptable and the ECL computation was consistent with the ECL model. |

## Other information

Management is responsible for the other information contained in the annual report.  Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.

We have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report except for the analysis of shareholding ('the Report'), which is expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In  connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If,  based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

## Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient  to  provide  a  reasonable  assurance  that  assets  are  safeguarded  against  loss  from  unauthorised  use  or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditors'  report  that  includes  our  opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.  We also:

- l Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
- l Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (Continued)

- l Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- l Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our  auditors'  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- l Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- l Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business activities  within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless the law or regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Tan Chun Wei (Chen Junwei).

Year ended 31 December 2022

These notes form an integral part of the financial statements.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 February 2023.

## 1 Domicile and activities

Singapura Finance Ltd  ('the Company') is incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and has its registered office at 150 Cecil Street, #01-00, Singapore 069543.

The principal activities of the Company are those relating to finance companies operating under the Finance Companies Act 1967.  The principal activities of the subsidiaries are set out in note 9 to the financial statements.

The financial statements of the Company as at end of the year ended 31 December 2022 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group' and individually as 'Group entities').

## 2 Basis of preparation

## 2.1 Statement of compliance

The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Singapore  Financial  Reporting  Standards (International) ('SFRS(I)').

## 2.2 Basis of measurement

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities which are measured at fair values.

## 2.3 Functional and presentation currency

These financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the Group's functional currency.  All financial  information  presented  in  Singapore  dollars  have  been  rounded  to  the  nearest  thousand,  unless otherwise stated.

## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is included in note 3.4 Impairment.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Year ended 31 December 2022

## 2 Basis of preparation (Continued)

## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements (Continued)

## Uncertain economic environment

The  uncertain  economic  environment  has  increased  the  estimation  uncertainty  in  developing  significant accounting estimates, predominantly related to expected credit losses and its related post-model adjustments.

The estimation uncertainty is associated with:

- l the  extent  and  duration  of  the  expected  economic  downturn  (and  forecasts  for  key  economic  factors including gross domestic product ('GDP'));
- l the extent and duration of the disruption to business arising from the expected economic downturn; and
- l the effectiveness of government and central bank measures that have and will be put in place to support businesses and consumers through this disruption and economic downturn.

The Company has developed accounting estimates based on forecasts of economic conditions which reflect expectations  and  assumptions  as  at  31  December  2022  about  future  events  that  management  believes  are reasonable in the circumstances.

There is a considerable degree of judgement involved in preparing forecasts. The underlying assumptions are also subject to uncertainties which are often outside the control of the Company. Accordingly, actual economic conditions  are  likely  to  be  different  from  those  forecast  since  anticipated  events  frequently  do  not  occur  as expected, and the effect of those differences may significantly impact accounting estimates included in these financial statements.

The impact of the uncertain economic environment on expected credit losses is discussed further in note 23.

## 2.5 Changes in accounting policies

## New standards and amendments

The Group has applied the following SFRS(I)s, amendments to and interpretations of SFRS(I) for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2022:

- l COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (Amendments to SFRS(I) 16)
- l Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to SFRS(I) 3)
- l Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-16
- l Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-37)
- l Annual Improvements to SFRS(I) standards 2018-2020

The application of these amendments to standards and interpretations does not have a material effect on the financial statements.

The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.

- (ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

- (iii) Loss of control

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

## (iv) Accounting for subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company's balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

## 3.2 Property, plant and equipment

## (i) Recognition and measurement

Items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and accumulated impairment losses.  Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

Cost  includes  expenditure  that  is  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  of  the  asset.  The  cost  of  selfconstructed assets includes:

- l the cost of materials and direct labour;
- l any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use;
- l when the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located; and
- l capitalised borrowing costs.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

If  significant  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  have  different  useful  lives,  they  are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.2 Property, plant and equipment (Continued)

## (i) Recognition and measurement (Continued)

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.

## (ii) Subsequent costs

The  cost  of  replacing  a  component  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  recognised  in  the carrying  amount  of  the  item  if  it  is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefits  embodied  within  the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably.  The carrying amount of the replaced  component  is  derecognised.    The  costs  of  the  day-to-day  servicing  of  property,  plant  and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.

## (iii) Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value.  Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment, unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.  Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:

| Freehold land and buildings    | -   | 40 years                                           |
|--------------------------------|-----|----------------------------------------------------|
| Leasehold land and buildings   | -   | Lease period or useful lives, whichever is shorter |
| Furniture and office equipment | -   | Between 5 and 8 years                              |
| Motor vehicles                 | -   | 4 years                                            |
| Computers                      | -   | Between 3 and 5 years                              |

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

## 3.3 Financial instruments

## (i) Recognition and initial measurement

## Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities

The Group initially  recognises  loans  and  receivables  and  deposits  when  they  are  originated.    All  other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

## Non-derivative financial assets

## Classification

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') - debt investments; FVOCI - equity investments; or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL').

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.

## Financial assets at amortised cost

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- l it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- l its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## Debt investments at FVOCI

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- l it  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- l its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## Equity investments at FVOCI

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading, the Company may irrevocably elect  to  present  subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI.  This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

## Financial assets at FVTPL

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the  requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses (Continued)

## Business model assessment

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management.  The information considered includes:

- l the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These  include  whether  management's  strategy  focuses  on  earning  contractual  interest  income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- l how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;
- l the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed;
- l how managers of the business are compensated - e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and
- l the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.

Financial assets that are held-for-trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

## Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition.    'Interest'  is  defined  as  consideration  for  the  time  value  of  money  and  for  the  credit  risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

In  assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument.  This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.  In making this assessment, the Group considers:

- l contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;
- l terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;
- l prepayment and extension features; and
- l terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses (Continued)

## Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (Continued)

A  prepayment  feature  is  consistent  with  the  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  criterion  if  the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally,  for  a  financial  asset  acquired  at  a  significant  discount  or  premium  to  its  contractual  par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

## Subsequent measurement and gains and losses

## Financial assets at amortised cost

These assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.    The amortised  cost  is  reduced  by  impairment  losses.    Interest  income,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.  Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

## Debt investments at FVOCI

These  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.  Interest  income  calculated  using  the  effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.  Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI.  On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.

## Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value.  Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.  Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

## Financial assets at FVTPL

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value.  Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.

## Non-derivative financial liabilities

## Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2022

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

## (iii) Derecognition

## Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

## Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.

## (iv) Modifications of financial assets

If  the  terms  of  a  financial  asset  are  modified,  then  the  Group  evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different.

If  the  cash  flows  are  substantially  different,  then  the  contractual  rights  to  cash  flows  from  the  original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- l fees  that  are  considered  in  determining  the  fair  value  of  the  new  asset  and  fees  that  represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- l other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If  cash  flows  are  modified  when  the  borrower  is  in  financial  difficulties,  then  the  objective  of  the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Group plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If  the  modification  of  a  financial  asset  measured  at  amortised  cost  or  FVOCI  does  not  result  in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss.

For  floating-rate  financial  assets,  the  original  effective  interest  rate  used  to  calculate  the  modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs or fees incurred and modification fees received adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If  such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

- (v) Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

- (vi) Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

## 3.4 Impairment

- (i) Non-derivative financial assets

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses ('ECLs') on:

- l financial assets measured at amortised costs; and
- l debt investments measured at FVOCI.

Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases:

- l 12-month  ECLs:  these  are  ECLs  that  result  from  default  events  that  are  possible  within  the  12 months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months); or
- l Lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.

## General approach

The Group applies the general approach to provide for ECLs on all other financial instruments.  Under the  general  approach,  the  loss  allowance  is  measured  at  an  amount  equal  to  12-month  ECLs  at  initial recognition.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.  When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining  whether  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset  has  increased  significantly  since  initial recognition  and  when  estimating  ECLs,  the  Group  considers  reasonable  and  supportable  information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.  This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.

If  credit  risk  has  not  increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments  improves  such  that  there  is  no  longer  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2022

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.4 Impairment (Continued)

- (i) Non-derivative financial assets (Continued)

## General approach (Continued)

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- l the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or
- l the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

The Group considers a financial guarantee to be in default when the debtor of the loan is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the creditor and the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held).  The Group only applies a discount rate if, and to the extent that, the risks are not taken into account by adjusting the expected cash shortfalls.

The Group considers Singapore Government securities and bank deposits to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is equivalent to 'investment grade' assigned by internationally recognised external credit rating agencies.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.

## Measurement of ECLs

ECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses.  Credit losses are measured at the present value of all  cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract  and  the  cash  flows  that  the  Group  expects  to  receive).    ECLs  are  discounted  at  the  effective interest rate of the financial asset.

## Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt investments at FVOCI are credit-impaired.  A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- l significant financial difficulty of the borrower;
- l a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;
- l the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
- l it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- l the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2022

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.4 Impairment (Continued)

- (i) Non-derivative financial assets (Continued)

## Presentation of allowance for ECLs in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.

For debt investments at FVOCI, loss allowances are charged to profit or loss and recognised in OCI.

Loss allowances for financial guarantee are recognised as a financial liability to the extent that they exceed the initial carrying amount of the financial guarantee less the cumulated income recognised.

## Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.  This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off.  However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

## (ii) Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  If any such indication exists,  then  the  asset's  recoverable  amount is estimated.  For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite  useful  lives  or  that  are  not  yet  available  for  use,  the  recoverable  amount  is  estimated  each year at the same time.  An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit ('CGU') exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.  For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.  Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised  in  prior  periods  are  assessed  at  each  reporting  date  for  any  indications  that  the  loss  has decreased or no longer exists.  An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

## 3.5 Employee benefits

## Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Year ended 31 December 2022

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.5 Employee benefits (Continued)

## Other long-term employee benefits

The Group's net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than defined contribution plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is accrued annually at a specified rate based on salaries paid to employees during the period.  Benefits are only applicable to employees who joined before 28 December 2002 and completed 12 years of continuous service.

## Short-term benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.  A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## 3.6 Provisions

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation.    Provisions  are  determined  by  discounting  the  expected  future  cash  flows  at  a  pre-tax  rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.

## 3.7 Interest

Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.  The effective interest  rate  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  the  estimated  future  cash  payments  and  receipts  through  the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability (or,  where appropriate, a shorter period) to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortised cost of the financial liability.  The effective interest rate is  established on initial recognition of the financial assets and is not revised subsequently unless contractually adjusted.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.  Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.

Interest income and expense presented in the income statement include interest on financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost on an effective interest rate basis.

Where charges are added to the principal financed at the commencement of the period, the general principle adopted for crediting income to profit or loss is to spread the income over the period in which the repayments are due using the following bases for the various categories of financing business:

## Interest income on loans and advances

In general, the basis adopted for crediting income from loans to profit or loss is to spread the interest over the period in which the repayments are due.  Interest on mortgage loans is charged on the annual/monthly/daily rest basis and credited to profit or loss in the period to which it relates.

## Interest rebate on hire purchase

Term charges on hire purchase and leasing transactions are accounted for using the Rule of 78 (sum of digits) method.  The balance of such term charges at the financial year end is carried forward as unearned charges.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2022

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.7 Interest (Continued)

Interest income from Singapore Government Securities

Interest  income from Singapore Government Securities is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.

Interest income from bank deposits

Interest income from bank deposits is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.

## 3.8 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the shareholder's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend date.

## 3.9 Government grants

Government grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss as 'other income' on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised, unless the condition for receiving the grant are met after the related expenses have been recognised. In this case, the grant is recognised when it becomes receivable.

## 3.10 Tax

Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.  Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets .

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  amounts  used  for  taxation  purposes.    Deferred  tax  is  not recognised for temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The  measurement  of  deferred  taxes  reflects  the  tax  consequences  that  would  follow  the  manner  in  which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended 31 December 2022

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.10 Tax (Continued)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  unused  tax  losses,  unused  tax  credits  and  deductible  temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

## 3.11 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

## As a lessee

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The  right-of-use  asset  is  subsequently  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  from  the  commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is  determined  on  the  same  basis  as  those  of  property  and  equipment.  In  addition,  the  right-of-use  asset  is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease  payments  that  are  not  paid  at  the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined,  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate.  Generally,  the  Group  uses  the  lessee's  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The Group determines the lessee's incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## As a lessee (Continued)

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- l fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- l amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- l the  exercise  price  under  a  purchase  option  that  the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise,  lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.  It  is  remeasured  when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised insubstance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'trade and other payables' in the balance sheet.

## Short term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including IT equipment. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## 3.12 Earnings per share

The  Group  presents  basic  and  diluted  earnings  per  share  data  for  its  ordinary  shares.    Basic  earnings  per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.  Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

## Extension options

Some property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Company up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Company seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Company and not by the lessors. The Company assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Company reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.

The Company has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $1,239,000 (2021: $1,003,000).

## 23 Financial risk management

## Overview

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

- l credit risk
- l liquidity risk
- l market risk

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital.

## Risk management framework

The  Board  of  Directors  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  establishment  and  oversight  of  the  Group's  risk management  framework.    The  Board  has  established  the  Risk  Management  Committee  ('RMC'),  which  is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies.  The RMC reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.

The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risk and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.  All major policy decisions and approval on risk exposures including loan limits are approved by the Board of Directors upon concurrence by the RMC.  In addition, internal audits are conducted on an on-going basis to confirm that these policies and procedures are functioning effectively and any deviations are duly highlighted for special attention.

## Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's loans and advances to customers.  For risk management reporting purposes, the Group considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure.

## Management of credit risk

The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of credit risk to the RMC, which in turn appoints the Credit Control Committee and Credit Portfolio Committee to assist in the management of credit risk.  The Credit Control Committee develops the credit risk management framework, policies and procedures for review and concurrence by RMC and approval by the Board of Directors. The Credit Control Committee also reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions.

Credit reviews are conducted regularly to monitor the health of the loan portfolio and to detect early signs of weaknesses and deviations.

The Credit Portfolio Committee manages risk on a portfolio-wide basis and recommends alternative portfolio strategies,  analyses  results  of  portfolio  management  actions,  and  develops  portfolio  limits  for  each  portfolio segment for approval by the RMC.  Credit risk concentration is addressed by setting a credit portfolio mix limit and monitoring the limit  on  a  regular  basis.  The  Credit  Portfolio  Committee  periodically  reviews  the  lending authority framework, portfolio concentration limits and credit stress test framework.

Credit stress tests are also conducted periodically to determine the impact of security values and other stress parameters on the loan portfolio.  This allows the Group to assess the potential financial impact of losses arising from plausible adverse scenarios on the Group's loan portfolio.

## Credit risk (Continued)

## Management of credit risk (Continued)

The SFRS(I) 9 Committee ('SC') works closely with Credit Portfolio Committee and Credit Control Committee to ensure that the Group has appropriate credit risk practices, including an effective system of internal control, to consistently  determine  adequate allowances in accordance with the Group's policies and procedures relating to  impairment  allowances  and  applicable  accounting  framework  under  SFRS(I)  9.  The  SC  also  reviews  and recommends updates to the Governance &amp; Control Framework of ECL Model as well as the Impairment Allowance Policy.  Any  material  changes  to  the  ECL  framework,  methodology  and  policies  are  reviewed  by  SC  before recommendation to the Audit Committee for concurrence and approval.

## Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment

## Assessment of significant increase in credit risk

When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.  This  includes  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  information  and  analysis,  based  on  the Group's historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Group considers significant increase in credit risk occurs when an asset is more than 30 days past due.

## Modified financial assets

The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 3.3 (iv).

For loans subjected to the COVID-19 repayment deferral arrangements, an assessment of significant increase in  credit  risk  has  been determined based on various measures of the customer's current financial position and earnings capacity from which the loans are categorised into risk categories - Low, Medium and High. Significant increase  in  credit  risk  is  then  determined  based  on  the  resulting  risk  categorisation.  Customers  who  have requested a deferral extension and are categorised as High risk are classified as having a significant increase in credit risk.

## Calculation of expected credit losses

Expected credit losses are calculated using three main components

- l probability of default ('PD');
- l loss given default ('LGD'); and
- l exposure at default ('EAD').

These components are generally derived from internally developed statistical models using historical, current and forward-looking macro-economic data such as GDP, unemployment and inflation. These factors were updated in the current year, reflecting the actual and expected impact of the uncertain economic environment.

## Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment (Continued)

## Calculation of expected credit losses (Continued)

## Probability of default

The 12-month and lifetime PD represent the expected point-in-time probability of a default over the next 12 months and remaining lifetime of the financial  instrument,  respectively,  based  on  conditions  existing  at  the balance sheet date and future economic conditions that affect credit risk.

The PD is derived using Delinquency Roll Rate Model which incorporates historical default rates over past years, adjusted for forward-looking information and reflecting current portfolio composition and market data such as GDP, unemployment and inflation.

## Loss given default

LGD represents expected loss conditional on default, taking into account the mitigating effect of collateral, its expected value when realised and the time value of money.

## Exposure at default

EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure  to  the  counterparty  and  potential  changes  to  the  current  amount  allowed  under  the  contract  and arising from amortisation. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations.

The 12-month ECL is equal to the discounted sum over the next 12 months of monthly PD multiplied by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the discounted sum of monthly PD over the full remaining life multiplied by LGD and EAD.

## Post-model adjustments

Post-model adjustments ('PMAs') are short-term adjustments to the ECL balance as part of the year-end reporting process  to  reflect  possible  model  limitations.  The  PMAs  are  sensitive  to  judgments  and  assumptions  made regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how such scenarios are incorporated in the calculations.

The Group has internal governance frameworks and controls in place to assess the appropriateness of PMAs. The aim of the Group is to incorporate these PMAs into the ECL models, where possible, as part of the periodic recalibration and model assessment procedures.

The Group has incorporated PMAs based on the forecasted GDP growth to capture possible limitations arising from the uncertain economic environment.

The above PMA as at 31 December 2022 increased the loss allowance by $1.6 million (2021: $0.9 million).

## Exposure to credit risk

The  maximum exposure  to  credit  risk  is  represented  by  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  assets  in  the statements of financial position, reduced by the value of the collateral held.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for loans and advances:

There  are  no  loans  and  advances  with  renegotiated  terms  that  are  neither  past  due  nor  impaired  as  at 31 December 2022 (2021: $Nil).

Past due but not impaired :  when contractual interest or principal payments are past due by not more than three months and the Group believes that impairment is not appropriate on the basis of the security available and/or the stage of collection.

Write  off :  The  Group  writes  off  wholly  or  partially  loan  balances  (together  with  any  related  allowances  for impairment losses) when the Group determines that the debts are irrecoverable, e.g. borrower has been made bankrupt, or all actions have been exhausted.

Repayment  deferral :  Since  March  2020,  the  Group  has  offered  various  forms  of  assistance  to  customers  to counteract the impact of COVID-19 on the ability of customers to meet their loan obligations. The assistance provided  has  included  arrangements  such  as  temporary  deferral  of  principal  and  interest  repayments,  and extension of loan maturity dates.

The loan repayment deferral is considered to be a loan modification (non-substantial modification) whereby the existing loan continues to be recognised.

The table below shows the gross carrying amount of loans that have been modified during the year:

|                                                 | Group and Company   | Group and Company   |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|                                                 | 2022 $'000          | 2021 $'000          |
| Interest servicing only                         | -                   | 15,313              |
| Full/partial deferral of principal and interest | 22                  | 264                 |
| Total                                           | 22                  | 15,577              |

The amortised cost of  loans  at  the  date  of  modification  that  were  considered  non-substantial  modifications and  had  loss  allowances  based  on  lifetime  expected  losses  was  $Nil  (2021:  $267,000).  No  gain  or  loss  was recognised as a result of the modification during 2022 and 2021 and the gross carrying amount of loans that have subsequently changed to a 12-month expected loss allowance was $2,054,000 (2021: $5,634,000).

The Group normally holds collateral against loans and advances to customers.  These are in the form of mortgage interests  over  property  and  ownership  or  other  registered  interests  over  assets.    Estimates  of  fair  value  of collateral are assessed in each accounting period prior to determination of individual impairment allowances.

The financial effect of collateral and other security enhancements held against loans and advances to customers is shown below:

At the reporting date, there was no significant concentration of credit risk.

## Debt investments

The Group and the Company held Singapore Government securities of $191,527,000 as at 31 December 2022 (2021: $130,902,000).  The credit rating of Singapore Government Securities held at the reporting date accorded by various international credit rating agencies is AAA (2021: AAA).  The Group considers that its debt investments have  low  credit  risk  based  on  the  external  credit  ratings  of  the  counterparties.  Hence,  the  amount  of  the allowance on debt investments is negligible.

## Cash and balances with banks

The Group and the Company held cash and balances with banks of $100,260,000 and $100,243,000 respectively as at 31 December 2022 (2021: $114,768,000 and $114,751,000).  The cash and balances with banks are mainly held with bank and financial institution counterparties which are rated BBB+ to AA, based on various international credit ratings.

Loss allowance on cash and balances with banks has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures.  The Group considers that its cash and balances with banks have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.

The Group uses a similar approach for assessment of ECLs for cash and balances with banks to those used for loans and advances. The amount of the allowance on cash and balances with banks is negligible.

## Statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore

The Group and the Company held statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore of $23,445,000 as at 31 December 2022 (2021: $24,361,000) which is rated AAA, based on various international credit ratings. Hence, the Group considers that its statutory deposits have low credit risk and the amount of allowance is negligible.

## Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.

## Management of liquidity risk

The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions,  without  incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.

The Group is currently funded from equity and deposit liabilities.  Liquidity risk arises from the management of the net funding position after accounting for the ongoing cash flows from the loan assets, the deposit liabilities and the interest-bearing placements at various points in time.

Liquidity risk is managed in accordance to the Group's liquidity framework of policies, contingency funding plan, controls and limits approved by the Asset and Liability Committee ('ALCO').  This framework ensures that liquidity risk is monitored and managed in a manner that ensures sufficient sources of funds are available over a range of market conditions.  Stress testing is conducted under the Group/Company-specific crisis and general market crisis scenarios.  This is undertaken to assess and plan for the impact of the scenarios which may put the Group's liquidity at risk.

Liquidity risk is also mitigated through the large number of customers in its diverse loans and deposits bases and the close monitoring of exposure to avoid any undue concentration.

## Maturity analysis of financial liabilities

The following are the contractual maturities of the Group's and Company's non-derivatives financial liabilities, loan commitments and contingent liabilities at the reporting date, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows (including interest payments) at the earliest date the Group and Company can be required to pay.

The expected cash flows on these instruments may vary significantly from this analysis.  In particular, deposits from customers are expected to maintain a stable balance; and undrawn loan commitments are not all available to be drawn down immediately upon finalisation of legal documentation due to factors like the progressive nature of the facility to be based on the stage of completion of work in progress.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Year ended 31 December 2022

## 23 Financial risk management (Continued)

## Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.  The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

## Currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of financial assets or liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  The Group is not exposed to foreign currency risk.

## Interest rate risk

Interest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  value  of  the  Group's  financial  assets  and/or  financial  liabilities  changes because of changes in interest rates.  Interest rate risk arises primarily from the fact that financial assets and financial liabilities typically reprice at different points in time.

A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of  some  interbank  offered  rates  ('IBORs')  with  alternative  nearly  risk-free  rates  (referred  to  as  'interest  rate benchmark reform'). The Group had exposures to swap offer rate ('SOR') on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. In Singapore, the Steering Committee for SOR and Singapore interbank offered rates ('SIBOR') transition to Singapore overnight rate average ('SORA') together with the Association of Banks in Singapore and Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee, has identified the SORA as the alternative interest rate benchmark to replace SIBOR and SOR in Singapore. The timeline for SORA to replace SOR and SIBOR is by the end of June 2023 and December 2024 respectively. As at 31 December 2022, the Group's remaining IBOR exposure arises from two syndicated loans that was indexed to SOR.

## Risk management policy

The overall objective of interest rate risk management is to manage current and future earnings sensitivity arising from various interest rate exposures.  Interest rate risk exposures are measured using a combination of repricing gap, present value of 1 basis point reports and simulation modelling.  The ALCO recommends policies, ratios and limits for review and concurrence by RMC and approval by the Board of Directors. The RMC assists the Board in ensuring the effective management of market risks. The ALCO meets periodically to review the risk profile of the Group against the prevailing business and economic conditions, focusing on market and interest rate risks.  The ALCO also relates the structure of assets and liabilities to funding mismatches and interest rate repricing risks and ensure compliance with the approved policies and risk exposures (including ratios and limits).

## Exposure to interest rate risk

The Group does not hold a trading portfolio.  The principal risk to which its non-trading portfolio is exposed arises from the risk of fluctuations in the future cash flows or fair values of financial instruments because of changes in  market interest rates.  Interest rate risk is managed principally through monitoring interest rate gaps and by having pre-approved limits for repricing bands.

The Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group's loan and investment portfolios as well as deposit liabilities.  Interest rate risk will arise when these assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times or in differing amounts, or when market conditions dictate the extent of repricing possible.  The Group manages this risk through diversity in its loan portfolio and to a lesser extent in its deposit portfolio.

## Sensitivity analysis

## Interest rate risk

Interest rate sensitivity analyses are performed under various interest rate scenarios using simulation modelling where the sensitivity of projected net interest income is measured against changes in market interest rates.

The projected impact on future net interest income before tax over the next twelve months from the close of the year is simulated under various interest rate assumptions.  Based on a 100 basis point parallel rise in yield curves applied to the reporting date position, net interest income is estimated to increase by $2,675,000 (2021: increase by $445,000).  The corresponding impact from a 100 basis point fall is an estimated reduction of $2,674,000 (2021: $3,484,000) in net interest income.

The sensitivity analysis of the Group is illustrative only.  It assumes that interest rates of all tenors move by the same amount and does not reflect the potential impact on net interest income of some rates changing while others remained unchanged.  The analysis also assumes that all financial assets and liabilities run to contractual maturity without action by the Group to mitigate any impact of such changes.

## Portfolio price risk

Portfolio price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to the individual security or factors that affect all instruments in the market.

At  the  reporting  date,  the  Group  has  FVOCI-debt  instruments  on  Singapore  Government  Securities  of approximately  $192  million  (2021:  $131  million).    A  1%  increase  in  prices  at  the  reporting  date  would  have increased  equity  by  $1.9  million  (2021:  $1.3  million).    An  equal  change  in  the  opposite  direction  would  have decreased equity by $1.9 million (2021: $1.3 million).  The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2021.

The sensitivity analysis is based on management's best estimate of the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change. In practice, the actual results will differ from the sensitivity analysis and the differences could be material.

## Capital management

## Regulatory capital

The Group maintains a capital adequacy ratio ('CAR') in excess of the prescribed ratio, which is expressed as a percentage of adjusted regulatory capital to total risk weighted assets.

- (1) The Group's adjusted regulatory capital includes share capital, capital reserve, statutory reserve, general reserve,  fair  value  reserve  relating  to  unrealised  losses  on  equity  securities  classified  as  FVOCI  and accumulated profits.

The fair value reserve relating to unrealised gains/losses on Singapore Government Securities classified as FVOCI-debt instruments and unrealised gains on equity securities classified as FVOCI-equity instruments are excluded from the Group's adjusted regulatory capital.

- (2) Risk-weighted assets are determined according to specified requirements by the Monetary Authority of Singapore that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to assets and off-balance sheet exposures.

The Group's regulatory capital position as at 31 December was as follows:

|                        | 2022 $'000   | 2021 $'000   |

| Capital adequacy ratio | 27.28%       | 25.08%       |

## 24 Fair values of financial instruments

In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and make assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.

Although management have employed their best judgement in the estimation of fair values, there is inevitably a significant element of subjectivity involved in the calculations.  Therefore, the fair value estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Group could have realised in a sales transaction at the reporting date.

The  methodologies  and  assumptions  used  depend  on  the  terms  and  risk  characteristics  of  the  various instruments and include the following:

## Financial instruments for which fair value approximates the carrying amount

The carrying values of statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, other receivables and deposits, cash and balances with banks and trade and other payables, approximate their fair values as these balances are short-term in nature or are receivable or payable on demand.

## Investment in Singapore Government Securities

The fair values of FVOCI-debt instruments are determined by reference to their quoted closing bid prices at the reporting date.

## Loans and advances

The fair value of loans and advances that mature or reprice within six months of the reporting date is assumed to equate to the carrying value.  The fair value of all other loans and advances was calculated using discounted cash flow models based on the maturity of the loans. The discount rates applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of loans.

## Deposits and savings accounts of customers

The  fair  value  of  deposits  and  savings  accounts  of  customers  which  mature  or  reprice  within  six  months  is estimated to be the carrying value at the reporting date.  The fair value of other term deposits was calculated using  discounted  cash  flow  models,  based  on  the  deposit  type  and  its  related  maturity.    The  discount  rates applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of deposits.

## Borrowings from MAS

The carrying value of the Borrowings from MAS approximates its fair values.

## Fair value hierarchy

The table below analyses fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities, by the levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques.  The different levels are defined as follows:

- l Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date.
- l Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
- l Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
