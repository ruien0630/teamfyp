💡 AI Answer (ibm/granite-4-h-small):  The financial institution segment experienced the largest year-on-year growth based on the segment revenue figures provided.

    In 2021, the financial institution segment had revenue of $20,039,631 while in 2022 it increased to $22,912,702. This represents an increase of approximately $2.87 million or about 14.3% year-over-year growth for that segment.

    For comparison, the non-financial institution segment went from $20,103,587 in 2021 to $20,664,631 in 2022 - an increase of only around $561k or 2.8% growth.

    Therefore, looking at the two segments side-by-side, the financial institution portion shows much more substantial top-line expansion between the two years compared to the other business area.

💡 AI Answer (ibm/granite-4-h-small):  The document provides a breakdown of the distribution of shareholdings by size of shareholding:

- There are 1,400 total shareholders.
- The largest group is those holding between 1,001 and 10,000 shares, comprising 838 shareholders (59.86%).
- This is followed by those holding between 10,001 and 1,000,000 shares, with 212 shareholders (15.14%).
- Shareholders holding over 1,000,001 shares make up the smallest group at just 11 individuals (less than 1%).

So in summary, the majority of shareholders hold between 1,001 and 10,000 shares, which accounts for nearly 60% of all shareholders.

💡 AI Answer (ibm/granite-4-h-small):  I do not have enough information to determine the revenue trend for the Non-FI Data Business from FY2019 to FY2022 based on the given context. The context only provides revenue figures for FY2021 and FY2022, but does not include any historical data going back to FY2019 that would allow me to identify the overall trend over that longer timeframe.
