TEO CHIANG LONG Executive Chairman

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present the  Annual  Report  and  Financial  Statements  of  the  Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 ('FY2020').

## PERFORMANCE REVIEW

The  operating  environment  for  FY2020  was  exceptionally challenging against a background of negative growth for the Singapore's  economy  due  to  COVID-19.  Nevertheless,  the Group recorded a profit from operations before allowances of  $7.9  million  for  the  financial  year  ended  31  December 2020,  3.9%  higher  vis-à-vis  the  same  period  last  year.  Net interest income and hiring charges decreased by $2.3 million or 11.1% as increase in cost of deposits outpaced the rise in interest income with a higher loan base. This was cushioned by the Government's COVID-19 grants included and disclosed under other operating income and the decline in total operating expenses owing to the strict discipline in the management of staff costs and other operating expenses.

There was a net charge for loan impairment losses amounting to  $2.3  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2020  as compared to a net write back of $1.4 million during the same period  last  year.  This  was  mainly  attributed  to  additional allowances for non-impaired loans with the weaker economic outlook in the current COVID-19 pandemic environment. As a  result  of  the  additional  loan  allowances,  the  Group's  net profit after tax declined by $2.7 million or 36.3% compared to last year.

With  the  higher  allowances  for  non-impaired  loans,  $2.0 million was released from Regulatory Loss Allowance Reserve to  accumulated  profit.  The  transfers  are  reflected  in  the Statement  of  Changes  in  the  Equity.  The  Group  continues to  set  aside  adequate  expected  credit  loss  allowances  in respect of its loan portfolio.

Notwithstanding the weaker performance, the Group's shareholders' funds remains strong at $255 million as at 31 December 2020, and is more than adequate to buffer further volatility  in  the  current  economic  slowdown.  Our  capital adequacy  ratio  continues  to  be  well  above  the  regulatory minimum requirement.

Other Comprehensive Income for the year ended  31 December  2020  declined  by  $3.8  million.  This  is  mainly due to decrease in the fair value of the equity investments which was partly cushioned by the increase in the fair value of  the  Singapore  Government  Securities  (SGS).  The  Group purchases  SGS  for  the  purposes  of  maintaining  minimum liquid assets as required under the Finance Companies Act.

## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

The Group's total loan net of allowances increased by 13.8% to $838 million as at 31 December 2020 compared to $736 million as at 31 December 2019. In line with the higher loan balance, the Group has actively managed the total deposits upwards by 7.3% to $907 million as at 31 December 2020.

In the opinion of the Directors, no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen which is likely to affect substantially the results of the operations of the Group and  the  Company  in  the  interval  between  the  end  of  the financial year and the date of this report.

## DIVIDENDS

In  a  media  release  on  7  Aug  2020,  MAS  urged  finance companies to cap their total dividends per share ('DPS') for FY2020  at  60%  of  FY2019's  level  and  encouraged  finance companies to offer shareholders the option of receiving the dividends to be paid for FY2020 in scrip in lieu of cash. The dividend restriction is a pre-emptive measure to bolster the finance companies' ability to continue to support the credit needs of businesses and consumers in the current business environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also balances the objective of capital conservation to sustain lending with the interests of shareholders who may rely on this income.

Subject to approval of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General  Meeting,  in  line  with  the  Group's  dividend  policy and  MAS  recommendations,  the  Board  is  recommending proposing a first and final one-tier tax exempt dividend of 1.5 cents per share and no special dividend for FY2020 (FY2019: First  and  final  one-tier  tax  exempt  dividend  of  2  cents  per share and a special one-tier tax exempt dividend of 1.5 cents per share). The total distribution of 1.5 cents per share for the  year  will  amount  to  approximately  $2.38  million.  The dividend shall be paid in cash as the Board deemed that it is not cost-beneficial to offer scrip dividend.

## OPERATIONS REVIEW

Credit risks of financial institutions have heightened due to the fallout of COVID-19. In order to safeguard the economy from  disruption  and  uncertainties,  MAS  has  announced a  slew  of  relief  measures  to  ease  the  financial  strain  on individuals  and  cash  flow  constraints  faced  by  businesses. We  have  extended  support  to  our  existing  customers  by offering interest/ principal moratoriums as part of our suite of relief measures. We continue to monitor the repayments of  our  customers  closely  and  lend  to  borrowers  with  good track records.

As part of our cost management measures, the Group has scaled back on staff costs with wage freeze and cut as well as suspension on some staff benefits in 2021. The wage cut is  applicable  to  all  staff  on  a  tiered  basis,  depending  on their level as we bear in mind that employees will have basic expense to upkeep. We will review the situation and reinstate the wage and benefits when deemed fit.

Before COVID-19, we have already started our digitalization efforts, searching for technological partners to further improve our customer engagement. COVID-19 have accelerated our adoption of digital  technologies.  Our  digital  initiatives  will help us remain relevant and connect to the younger and techsavvy customers. It will also help to streamline and enhance work processes, productivity and our customers' experience.

## OUTLOOK

The Singapore economy contracted by 2.4% on a year-onyear  basis  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  an  improvement from the 5.8% contraction recorded in the third quarter. On a  quarter-on-quarter  seasonally-adjusted  annualised  basis, the economy expanded at a slower pace of 3.8%, compared to the 9.0% growth in the preceding quarter. For the whole of 2020, the economy contracted by 5.4% within the earlier forecast of '-6.5% to -6.0%', a reversal from the 1.3% growth recorded in 2019.

The  global  pandemic  economic  situation  has  remained subdued.  While  some  economies  like  China  are  expected to  see  a  sustained  recovery  as  their  domestic  COVID-19 outbreaks  remain  under  control,  others  like  the  US  and Eurozone are experiencing a resurgence in infections, which may dampen their recovery as restrictions are re-imposed to slow the spread of the virus which have negative spill over effects on the region and Singapore. Taking into account the global and domestic economic environment, the Ministry of Trade and Industry ('MTI') announced earlier in November 2020 that it expected a GDP growth of '4.0% to 6.0%' for 2021. The recovery of the Singapore economy in the year ahead is expected to be gradual, and will depend to a large extent  on  how  the  global  economy  performs  and  whether Singapore is able to continue to keep the domestic COVID-19 situation under control.

Given the modest economic outlook, the Group expects a challenging time ahead. Nevertheless, the Group will continue to be prudent in seeking new business opportunities and be proactive  in  managing  our  credit  exposure  and  operating expenses to remain competitive.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to extend my appreciation to our valued clients and business associates for their continued support and to our  shareholders  for  their  patience  and  loyalty  amidst  this difficult period. I also thank my fellow Board members for their continual support, counsel and guidance. I also acknowledge and commend our management and staff for their diligence and hard work for their contribution to the Group.

## ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE

The Group recorded a profit from operations before allowances of $7.9 million for the financial year ended 31 December 2020, 3.9%  higher  vis-à-vis  the  same  period  last  year.  Net  interest income and hiring charges decreased by $2.3 million or 11.1% as  increase  in  cost  of  deposits  outpaced  the  rise  in  interest income  with  a  higher  loan  base.  This  was  cushioned  by  the Government's COVID-19 grants included and disclosed under other  operating  income  and  the  decline  in  total  operating expenses owing to the strict discipline in the management of staff costs and other operating expenses.

There was a net charge for loan impairment losses amounting to $2.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 as compared to a net write back of $1.4 million during the same period last year. This was mainly attributed to additional allowances for nonimpaired loans with the weaker economic outlook in the current

COVID-19 pandemic environment. As a result of the additional loan  allowances,  the  Group's  net  profit  after  tax  declined  by $2.7 million or 36.3% compared to last year.

With the higher allowances for non-impaired loans, $2.0 million was  released  from  Regulatory  Loss  Allowance  Reserve  to accumulated profit. The transfers are reflected in the Statement of  Changes  in  the  Equity.  The  Group  continues  to  set  aside adequate expected credit loss allowances in respect of its loan portfolio.

Notwithstanding the weaker performance, the Group's shareholders'  funds  remains  strong  at  $255  million  as  at  31 December 2020, and is more than adequate to buffer further volatility in the current  economic  slowdown.  Our  capital adequacy  ratio  continues  to  be  well  above  the  regulatory minimum requirement.

## FINANCIAL REVIEW

Other Comprehensive Income for the year ended 31 December 2020 declined by $3.8 million. This is mainly due to decrease in  the  fair  value  of  the  equity  investments  which  was  partly cushioned  by  the  increase  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Singapore Government  Securities  (SGS).  The  Group  purchases  SGS  for the purposes of maintaining minimum liquid assets as required under the Finance Companies Act.

The Group's total loan net of allowances increased by 13.8% to $838 million as at 31 December 2020 compared to $736 million

Net interest income fell by $2.3m or 11.1% for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the same period last year mainly due to higher cost of funds which outpaced the increase in total interest income.

Total interest income rose by $1.10m or 3.8% mainly attributed to  the  growth  in  the  volume  of  loan  and  advances  partially offset by drop in interest recovery from non-performing loans.

Total  deposits  and  savings  accounts  of  customers  grew  in tandem with the expansion in loan and advances and to maintain a healthy loan-to-deposit ratio within our Management Action Trigger of 100%. The cost of funds increased from 1.40% to 1.42% during the period.

As the rate of increase in cost of funds is more than the asset yield, the Group's net interest margin as a percentage of the interest-earning assets decreased from 2.18% to 1.57%.

as at 31 December 2019. In line with the higher loan balance, the Group has actively managed the total deposits upwards by 7.3% to $907 million as at 31 December 2020.

In the opinion of the Directors, no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen which is likely to affect substantially the results of the operations of the Group and the Company in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report.

Non-interest income for FY2020 increased by 93.0% to $2.4 million primarily attributed to receipts of Government COVID-19 Grants partially offset by the lower fees and commissions from early settlement of loans and lower loan processing/acceptance fees.

| Total Write-back of/(Allowances for) Impairment Losses (Net) | (2,317) | 1,368  | (269.4)      |

There was a net charge for loan impairment losses amounting to $2.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 as compared to a net write back of $1.4 million during the same period last year. This was mainly attributed to additional allowances for nonimpaired loans with the weaker economic outlook in the current COVID-19 pandemic environment.

| Total Equity   | 254,623      | 259,164      | (1.8)        |

The decrease in total equity was mainly due to the decline in the fair value of the unquoted equity investments designated as Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - Equity Instruments of which the Group intends to hold for long-term strategic purpose.

## BOARD STATEMENT

The Board of Directors ('the Board') is pleased to present our fourth Sustainability Report (the 'Report').

At  Singapura  Finance  Ltd  ('SFL'  and  the  'Company'),  we consider environmental, social and governance ('ESG') issues in our business strategies and operations whilst driving business growth. The Company takes a strategic approach that is guided by our core values of Shareholder Value, People Development, Integrity, Customer Focus and Efficiency ('S.P .I.C.E').

Together with Management, the Board continues to identify opportunities relevant to the long-term success of the Company. This year, we re-validated the material ESG factors that were identified previously as of high importance to our business and stakeholders. The Sustainability Steering Committee ('SSC') continues to support the Board in overseeing the management and monitoring of these factors.

We are  monitoring  the  coronavirus  ('COVID-19')  pandemic situation and its impacts on our business closely. SFL puts the utmost priority on the health and safety of our stakeholders. We have implemented precautionary measures to minimise the risk  of  spread  of  COVID-19, such as temperature-taking and mandatory health declaration for employees and customers.

On top of that, we implemented safe distancing measures at our head office and customer centres to safeguard the wellbeing of our staff and customers. During this COVID-19 period, we also conducted our trainings online and we are looking to transit  to  more  online  trainings  going  forward.  Furthermore, SFL  has  participated  actively  in  the  various  governmentinitiated relief measures to support the people and companies impacted  by  the  pandemic.  For  instance,  SFL  implemented the  Special  Financial  Relief  Scheme,  which  allows  qualified customers to apply for payment deferment or to make reduced payment.  SFL  also  participated  in  the  Temporary  Bridging Loan ('TBL') programme, which grants loans to Small-Medium Enterprises  ('SMEs')  that  require  working  capital  for  their business operations.

In  this  Report,  we  are  proud  to  share  our  sustainability approach as well as our sustainability progress for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. This year, we have enhanced our  Report  by  deepening  our  performance  disclosures  as well  as  demonstrating  our  commitment  of  safeguarding  our stakeholders especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The  Board  would  like  to  thank  all  who  have  been  with  us throughout  our  sustainability  journey.  We  will  continue  our sustainability efforts in order to enhance the long-term value and trust to our stakeholders.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

## Economic Performance 203-2, GRI 204-1]

Economic growth is one of the primary factors that contributes to  the  business  continuity  of  SFL;  and  it  is  crucial  that  we continue  to  be  prepared  and  resilient  against  potential disruptions  in  our  business  strategies  or  operations.  Since 2019, the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS') statistics indicated  that  industry  loan  growth  is  maintained  amidst volatile macroeconomic conditions. The industry outlook has fuelled SFL's core business and with our dedicated efforts in managing our credit exposure and operating expense, SFL has achieved strong economic performance this year 8 .

Our  economic  value  distributed  include  our  employees' compensations, taxes as well as dividends to shareholders. SFL  strives  to  provide  shareholders  with  a  predictable  and sustainable dividend return over the long term. The Company is proposing a final dividend of 1.5 cents per share for FY2020.

SFL  is  committed  to  being  sustainable  in  our  economic growth  to  enhance  our  shareholder's  returns  and  deliver rewards to our employees. For more information regarding our economic performance in 2020, please refer to pages 54 to 105 of the Annual Report.

SFL plays our role in supporting the Sustainable Development Goal  ('SDG')  of  Decent  Work  and  Economic  Growth  by providing  financing  and  other  financial  services  to  SMEs, local companies and individuals. In 2020, we have grown our lending business by S$102 million (13.7%) in our continuing support for the local economy.

We indirectly drive and contribute to the local economy and labour force by providing employment opportunities as well as sourcing from local suppliers. The following depicts SFL's supply chain expenditure from 2017 to 2020.

This  year,  we  have  maintained  our  percentage  of  local spending to 98%, thereby continuing our goal of providing support  for the local  economy  by  sourcing  from  local suppliers.

As  a  support  to  the  community  through  the  COVID-19 pandemic,  SFL  actively  participated  in  the  various  relief programmes  rolled  out  by  MAS  and  Enterprise  Singapore. The  total  loan  relief  granted  to  corporate  and  consumer accounts were about 12% of SFL's loan portfolio. To support SMEs  in  the  pandemic,  SFL  has  also  participated  in  the programmes  rolled  out  by  Enterprise  Singapore,  including TBL, which is granted to SMEs who required working capital for  their  business  operations  during  this  year.  A  total  TBL loan of about 2% of our loan portfolio was granted this year. Going forward, SFL aims to continue to enhance our positive influences  on  the  local  economy  by  growing  our  lending business and sourcing from local suppliers.

## Responsible Lending

[GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3]

SFL's management  is committed to ensuring that our sustainability  strategy  is  embedded  into  our  responsible financing  practices.  In  recent  years,  increasing  responsible lending practices have been developed and adopted in the industry.  It  is  currently  an  industry  trend  and  best  practice. Our  management  continues  their  efforts  in  supporting  the Association of Banks Singapore ('ABS') Guidelines on Responsible Financing.

We  have  a  Credit  Risk  Management  Policy  which  provide guidelines on  establishing and  reviewing risk tolerance parameters  within  our  credit  strategy.  The  policy  ensures the  creditworthiness  of  the  clients  before  entering  into  a regulated  credit  agreement  or  significantly  increasing  their credit  limit.  This  ensures  that  we  do  not  take  on  excessive credit risks. Furthermore, we have a Marketing Manual that formalises our lending guidelines as well as processes for due diligence.

The  management  is  looking  to  expand  existing  practices towards a more robust lending practice in line with responsible lending trends in the banking industry.

In  line  with  Singapore's  Climate  Action  Plan  to  build  a 'Climate-Resilient Singapore, for a Sustainable Future' 9 , SFL strives to continue contributing to this movement by reducing our own environmental and carbon footprint.

To do so, we have implemented policies and procedures to manage our energy use such as educating our employees and engaging them in matters concerning energy consumption. As part of our 'Go Green' initiative, we have communicated green information periodically using both formal and informal communication tools to encourage our employees to be more energy efficient. For example, we remind our employees to switch to sleep mode on their electronic devices and switch off  lightings  and  air-conditioners  when  they  are  not  in  use. Furthermore,  we  monitor  our  electricity  bills  diligently  to identify and address any abnormal usage as well as rectify any equipment malfunctioning. Since 2019, recycling bins have been installed in our office and we continue to encourage our employees to adopt better recycling habits.

Electricity usage is our main source of energy consumption. With the extra efforts that we took in energy reduction and because of the reduction of hours spent in the office subject to the work-from-home arrangements, we were able to reduce our  energy  consumption 10   by  5.86%  but  energy  intensity increased by 3.1% 11 .

The following charts present SFL's annual energy consumption (kWh) and energy intensity by number of employees (kWh/ employees).

From  July  2020,  80%  of  SFL's  marketing  documentation process, including the submission of credit proposal, supporting documents and correspondences has gone paperless.  The  adoption  of  e-submission  has  enabled  SFL to reduce usage of paper and ink, contributing to our 'Go Green' efforts.  Consequently,  less  waste  is  generated  and this also results in cost savings for SFL.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

In  the  upcoming  year,  SFL  aims  to  continue  our  energy saving efforts to maintain our energy consumption and GHG emissions as of FY2019 numbers.

## SOCIAL

## People Development

Employees  are  the  greatest  asset  of  our  business  at  SFL. Therefore,  as  part  of  our  efforts  to  create  a  positive  and inclusive culture, we focus on attracting and retaining the best talents.  This  is  important  because a high retention rate will create a positive work environment, thus strengthening our employees'  commitment  to  the  organization  and  ensuring the continuity of our business.

SFL's  general  employment  practices,  such  as  developing career opportunities, cultivating a team culture and organizing team bonding events, support the SDGs of Decent Work and Economic  Growth,  Gender  Equality  and  Good  Health  and Well-Being.  These  practices  foster  a  strong  and  nurturing environment  for  our  employees  and  builds  a  sense  of belonging within SFL.

## COVID-19

To safeguard  the health of  our  employees  during  the COVID-19  pandemic,  our  Human  Resources  Department ('HR') provided advisories for employees to adhere to safe management  measures.  We  are  guided  by  the  Ministry of  Health  ('MOH'),  Ministry  of  Manpower  ('MOM')  and Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS')'s COVID-19 advisories and safe management measures, especially those relevant for workplaces. The advisories were sent out to all employees via email; and a copy is also made available in the online shared drive for employees' easy access.

We  have  implemented  the  mandated  requirement  and ensured compliance among employees, such as temperature taking  and  social  distancing.  We  have  also  placed  hand sanitisers  at  high  touch  points  for  our  employees  and customers to use. For the pantry and board room, advisories were placed at the entrance, indicating the number of people allowed inside at any one point in time. We appointed safe management officers and representatives to conduct rounds within the head office and in each customer centre to ensure that the safe management measures are followed.

We have also  arranged  a  split  team  work  arrangement  for employees to limit and minimise contact. Some of our staff were deployed to different work sites or on different floors within the head office, while other staff worked from home or on-site. During the Singapore circuit breaker period 15 , 65% of our Head Office employees were either working from home or on staggered working hours.

SFL  also enhanced  our  digitalisation tools with our IT department.  Resources  were  provided  and  systems  were put in place, such as conducting meetings via Zoom, a video conferencing  platform,  and  deploying  Electronic  Forms  to enable employees to work from home. We also conducted two Zoom-based trainings for the company concerning the Electronic Forms and the Electronic Filing System. Recently, our marketing team performed an online demonstration on how to use Adobe Reader to digitally sign on PDF documents. This  system  is  currently  supported  by  our  marketing  team with approvals being done digitally by our CEO. To further safeguard  our  cyber  security,  we  also  implemented  a  VPN solution within two weeks and established a 2-Factor Authentication system to ensure security.

The drive towards digitalisation is an on-going process within SFL. It was accelerated due to the COVID-19 situation. All of the above measures utilised our existing infrastructure, with no major cost to the company for implementation.

## Talent Retention

[GRI 102-7, GRI 102-8, GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 405-1]

## (i)  Recruitment

Despite  the  COVID-19  impacts  on  the  workforce,  we continue  to  embrace  the  Tripartite  Guidelines  on  Fair Employment  Practices  in  recruiting  talents  regardless of their gender, race, religion, cultural and family background. For example, SFL values the experience of the  older  generation  and  supports  them  to  re-join  the workforce.  Where  eligible,  SFL  extends  re-employment opportunities to eligible staff upon their retirement.

SFL  recruits  potential  employees  through  a  vast  range of channels such as collaborating with professional recruitment consultants, leveraging on internet recruitment platforms  and  encouraging  staff  referrals.  In  addition, we have started reaching out to tertiary institutions as a channel of recruitment. Due to the COVID-19 situation, we are conducting recruitment interviews online.

| Executive Level     | > 50 years old    |           22 |

## (ii) Employment Practices

We believe in enforcing fair employment practices across all  levels  of  the  Company and have set in place various schemes  such  as  cross  training  and  inter-departmental transfers  to  enhance  diversity  of  employee's  job  scope. This  practice  provides  employees  with  new  learning opportunities and cultivate expertise. This platform also encourages meetings between colleagues from different departments which helps bridge inter-departmental understanding  and  synergies.  This  will  help  to  improve the  camaraderie  and  collaborative  culture  within  the Company. Furthermore, conversing with colleagues from other departments can inspire more creative solutions as they are able to offer fresh perspectives.

We also adopt an open appraisal system for our employees to  set  goals  and  receive  feedback.  Formal  appraisal exercise is conducted annually to align and assess each individual's growth and development. During the session, targets and performance are discussed and documented properly to recognise each individual's progress.

SFL dedicates its time and efforts on an open-door policy by  establishing  a  platform  for  employees  to  clarify  on policies,  raise  concerns  to  the  management and initiate discussions on areas for improvements as well as career aspirations  with  their  Heads  of  Departments  ('HOD') or HR. HODs will conduct informal feedback sessions to address our employees concerns when necessary.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

Furthermore, it is our priority to ensure the safety of our staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, meetings and  discussions  for  cases  involving  staff  from  different work  sites  were  held  online.  Inter-branch  transfers  are also  approved  on  a  case-by-case  basis  depending  on the needs of the respective branches. This is to minimise interaction between staff from different work sites. In the event where inter-branch transfers need to occur, the staff will observe quarantine (from other colleagues) at home before his/her transfer.

## (iii)  Remuneration Policies and Staff Benefits

Adopting  a  competitive  remuneration  policy  effectively helps SFL to retain top talents. Remuneration and benefits are benchmarked against compensation reports and surveys. Salary revision and any variable benefits are reviewed and approved by the management annually to ensure fairness in rewarding our employees.

Other than a competitive remuneration policy, SFL hopes to  enrich  our  employees  work  life  by  providing  a  wide variety  of  staff  benefits,  such  as  medical,  dental  and staff    insurance.  Since  2019,  we  have  integrated  dental and  health  screening  benefits  into  wellness  benefits  to enhance  the  flexibility  of  employee  benefit  claims.  Our benefits  policies  are  reviewed  periodically  to  ensure relevance.

## (iv)  Employee Well-being

We believe that  a  good  workplace  is  where  employees can achieve work-life balance and establish a strong sense of belonging. Therefore, we offer different initiatives and benefits  to  promote  health  and  well-being,  to  build  a healthy work environment.

Since 2018, we  have implemented  flexible working arrangement where employees could stagger their working hours to balance their personal and work commitments. Employees are able to apply for staggered working arrangements, with different reporting times to accommodate  family  responsibilities.  We  managed  to achieve our target of having more employees on board this program, with 15 employees enrolled in the program this  year.  We  have  received  positive  feedback  from  our employees on this arrangement. SFL aims to continue to support our employees in achieving work-life balance.

SFL  encourages  our  employees  to  exercise  and  stay healthy. Every year, SFL participates in the National Steps Corporate Challenge, organised by the Health Promotion Board  to  encourage  the  adoption  of  an  active  lifestyle. In 2020, the event was cancelled due to restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic. If the situation permits, SFL will continue to participate in  the  National  Steps  Corporate Challenge in 2021.

We  also  aspire  to  build  better  teamwork  within  the Company to strengthen our cohesiveness and efficiency. Every year, we aim to promote a positive and engaging work  environment  for  all  staff  by  conducting  at  least three company events each year. Due to the COVID-19 situation in 2020, we were able to conduct two events this year  -  our  Chinese  New  Year  celebration  and  our  Long Service Awards and Customer Centre Awards via Zoom. These  events  are  well-received  by  our  staff.  In  2020, the  presentation  of  Long  Service  Awards  and  Customer Centre Awards were done in smaller settings where the Branch  Managers  gave  out  the  awards.  This  encourage more participation from our staff  and  fosters  a  stronger sense of recognition.

Moving  forward,  we  aim  to  encourage  flexible  working arrangements  to  more  employees  when  needed,  as  a means of supporting work-life balance.

## (v) Exit

SFL conducts exit interviews with employees to understand their reasons for leaving and schedule follow-ups as part of  our  efforts  to  improve  on  our  retention  policies  and practices.

We  collect  ad-hoc  feedback  from  our  employees  and conduct benchmarking analysis against industry practice and government initiatives to make improvements to our staff  policies  and  initiatives.  Our  retention  policies  are recognised by our employees and reflected from the large number of long serving employees.

## Training and Education

[GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 404-2]

We aim to nurture our employees through extensive training and development programs. In the fast-paced and ever-changing financial  industry,  SFL  enables  employees  to  have  the  opportunity  to  upskill  themselves,  allowing  them  to  improve  their existing skillsets and stay relevant.

In 2020, we participated in the Ngee Ann Polytechnic internship programme where we offered placement opportunities to two students from the Business Digitalisation Track. Through this program, we offered students with learning opportunities and assisted them in their transition to the corporate world.

Examples of other trainings and education initiatives conducted during the year include:

| Digital Workplace Trainings                                                                                                                                                               | Anti-Money Laundering ('AML')/Countering the Financing of Terrorism ('CFT') Trainings                                                                                                                                                        | Compliance Trainings                                                                                             | Professional Certification                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Provide trainings in relation to digital topics such as l Cashless and digital communications l E-transactions l Use of applications for communication l Cybersecurity and data analytics | • Provide new joiners with AML/CFT training in the first 6 months to equip them with necessary knowledge and skillsets • Engage an external consultant to train existing employees about new and recent development in AML/CFT every 2 years | Provide trainings in relation to compliance such as l Security awareness for customer privacy l Operational risk | • Sponsor staff to participate in training courses relating to professional certification for career advancement |

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, employees attend these training sessions online. In November 2020, all our employees attended the AML refresher training course via Zoom.

Moving forward, we will continue to identify and offer relevant trainings to employees to enhance their career and professional development and ensure they continue to meet 100% attendance for all mandatory training requirements for their roles. Furthermore, we aim to continue to develop more online trainings to ease employees' access to trainings.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

## CUSTOMER FOCUS

Customer focus  has  always  been  part  of  SFL's  core  values. We believe that it starts from within by creating a customer centric culture and investing in our people.

We build trust and long-term relationships by being responsive and relevant to our customers' needs. By understanding and connecting with our customers, we are able to provide quality products and services to meet their needs.

This  continuous  journey  to  deliver  value  and  an  engaging experience  to  our  customers  has  resulted  in  the  launch  of several  digital  initiatives.  One  such  initiative  is  the  Online Fixed Deposit renewal. Existing personal banking customers can submit online instructions for the renewal of their fixed deposit.  We  will  aim  to  continue  our  efforts  to  elevate customer  experience  both  online  and  physical  visits  at  our customer centres.

## Customer Privacy

## [GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 418-1]

As a financial  business,  trust  is  the  foundation  of  our  operations. Due  to  the  nature  of  our  business,  we  are  proactive  in safeguarding our customers' data through stringent practices of data privacy on sensitive and confidential information and our  emphasis  on  'Zero  breach'  on  data  privacy.  Our  staff are duly trained in these practices, enabling us to enhance customer loyalty and forge long-term relationships with our clients.

In addition, SFL complies with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 ('PDPA') and Information Security Policy that has been approved by our Operational and Technology Risk Committee ('OPTECH') and the Risk Management Committee ('RMC'). The OPTECH is updated bi-monthly  and RMC is updated quarterly  to  ensure  that  the  policies  remain  relevant.  Our compliance department also signs up for the MAS mailing list for regular updates and the accounts department will check MASNET daily for any announcements or circulars which will be forwarded to the compliance department. The compliance department then ensures that any changes in regulations are communicated to the relevant departments within 3 working days  for  further  action.  We  have  implemented  and  revised our policies to secure sensitive data, such as SFL's Information Security Policy, Portable Storage Devices Policy and Mobile Device Acceptable Use and Security Policy.

To  safeguard  confidential  information  and  prevent  data leakage,  we  have  implemented  the  Data  Loss  Prevention ('DLP') in the system. All employees  are  required to attend  and  complete  an  assessment  on  security  awareness conducted by the Technology Security Team to enhance their understanding  on  data  confidentiality.  Reminders  are  sent from  time  to  time  on  data  confidentiality.  We  also  engage an external vendor to carry out penetration tests on internet facing systems periodically to assess the vulnerability of our IT systems and networks.

In  2020,  we  have  achieved  our  target  of  having  no  known complaints received from Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC'), customers, outside parties or regulatory  bodies  regarding  breaches  of  customer  privacy and losses  of  data.  We  aim  to  continue  our  efforts  in  data protection  and  maintain  this  performance  in  the  following year.

## Marketing and Labelling

## [GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 417-2, GRI 417-3]

SFL recognises the importance of fair representation through labelling and communication to ensure customer confidence in  our  services  and  to  protect  our  corporate  image.  For instance, we adhere strictly to our marketing and advertising guidelines  and  practice  good  corporate  governance  within the Company. This is to ensure that key information presented is clear and accurate.

SFL provides trainings for our Relationship Managers ('RM') on  products,  policies,  market  updates  etc.  We  ensure  that our  RMs  are  trained  to  support  our  customers  clearly  and fairly. They also receive coaching on AML and our Company's internal policies.

Our marketing material contents are reviewed and assessed by  the  Marketing  Department  and  the  Communications Department  for  appropriateness  and  accuracy  to  reach  to the  targeted  audience  and  achieve  desired  communication outcomes.

We have achieved our target of having no reported incidents for non-compliance with voluntary codes nor non-compliance with  regulations  resulting  in  a  significant  fine,  penalty  or warning  in  respect  of  product  and  service  information  and labelling and marketing communications in 2020. SFL aims to continue this performance in the following year.

## Assessment for Agents and Customers

We practice screening and due diligence on referral agents  prior  to  any  engagement.  Different  assessments, including  company  search  and  World-Check  search  on  the referral  agency;  litigation  search  and  World-Check  search on  company's  directors  as  well  as  assessment  on  their  key personnel experiences are conducted to reduce risk in debt issues. Other screening methods include conducting research on the property agents who refer property loans to SFL online. The research ensures that they hold a valid license issued by Council for Estate Agencies ('CEA').

SFL  also  issues  guidelines  and  implement  procedures  on customer  due  diligence.  These  include  approved  lending guidelines, independent review by the RMC as well as type and frequency of valuation for collateral.

We categorise our customers and initiate Know Your Customer ('KYC') procedures to meet our business needs. Customers such  as  individual  applicants  and  personal  guarantors  are screened  via  Credit  Bureau  Singapore  ('CBS'),  litigation

and blacklist search as well as World-Check search. On the other hand, corporate clients and corporate guarantors are screened via CBS FICO 16 , litigation search and blacklist search as well as World-Check search.

The rigor of our assessment is also based on the collateral value and levels of risks. Effective and progressive procedures are  in  place  to  better  manage  risks  and  ensure  sustainable economic success. As a continuous practice at SFL, different functions share responsibilities to ensure the effectiveness of our assessment.

- The  Risk  Management  Department  ('RMD')  performs independent assessments for loans more than $5 million on an obligor basis.
- The Credit Control Committee reviews and approves for monthly monitoring of non-performing loans ('NPL').
- Relationship  Managers  initiate  regular  visits  for  higher valued loans and customers in more high-risk industries such as oil and gas, construction and hospitality.
- Credit Control Department and Credit Control Committee proactively  monitor  payment  patterns  on  a  daily  and monthly basis respectively.

Additionally, active performing loans ('APL') need to undergo  bi-annual  indicative  valuation  while  NPL  undergo quarterly indicative valuation. Any shortfall in collateral value is reported to the Credit Control Committee.

In  2020,  all  new  referral  agents  were  screened  for  their responsible  practices  before  we  engaged  them.  All  new customers were also screened for their profiles and repayment ability.  We  have  achieved our targets and will continue the good practice, to maintain 100% screening for new customers and agents in the following year.

## Customer Experience

[GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3]

Delivering excellent customer service helps strengthen customer loyalty and advocacy. In line with SFL's core values of customer focus and efficiency, we believe that a pleasant and positive experience is essential in building our brand.

We  strive  to  improve  our  customer  experience  through accessible feedback channels such as SFL's website, email and feedback forms as well as the immediate feedback system via customer survey tablets available at our customer centres. To allow for more immediate feedback, we also implemented a new feedback system via  Facebook  Messenger.  Customers have  responded  well  to  this  new  feedback  channel  with most  enquiries  centred  on  SFL's  Vivid  Savings  accounts 17 . Going forward, we aim to enhance our customer experience through understanding and anticipating customer needs by monitoring and leveraging on the success of the immediate feedback system.

To ensure that action is taken after receiving feedback, our Feedback and Complaint Handling Process has been set in place to enhance customers' experience with SFL. The policy contains procedures to acknowledge feedback, to investigate feedback  and  to  make  an  official  reply  to  customers.  All records  regarding  feedback  and  complaints  will  be  filed with the RMD for further analysis and reference. The RMD, Communications Department and Management are updated on this policy annually.

To  enhance  and  improve  on  the  quality  of  our  customer service, our employees, especially those with customer-facing roles,  have  received  trainings,  including  on-the-job  training by the branch managers on customer service.

In  2020,  SFL  met  the  target  by  ensuring  all  customers' feedback  or  complaints  received  via  any  delivery  channel have been acknowledged and resolved promptly as per SFL's Feedback and Complaints Handling Process. We have also achieved  our  target  of  ensuring  that  all  call  back  requests received via the tablets at our customer centres are addressed in  a  timely  manner.  SFL  aims  to  continue  to  maintain  this performance in the following year. By addressing the issues in a timely manner, we aim to maintain our Company's brand reputation and to improve on existing processes to meet our clients' needs more efficiently.

## Local Communities

[GRI 413-1]

SFL provides opportunities to engage our people in corporate social responsibility projects. Leveraging on their time and efforts, employees contribute meaningfully to the communities we live and work in. We believe that engaging with communities will help SFL to build a caring and giving culture, which will bring our people together and strengthen the community we live in.

Since 2019, SFL kicked off the new practice to better facilitate employee volunteerism. Our people could apply for time off to volunteer on a regular basis with Willing Hearts for their food kitchen projects. In view of the restrictions imposed by the  COVID-19  pandemic,  this  has  been  suspended  for  the year 2020. Going forward to 2021, where possible, we aim to engage employees and collaborate with more organisations to make a difference to our society. In the long run, we hope to make this giving culture an intrinsic part of our Company and to help provide more positive impact as a Company.

## GOVERNANCE

## Compliance with Laws and Regulations

[GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 419-1]

In  order  to  maintain  the  trust  of  our  stakeholders,  we understand  that  it  is  important  to  be  compliant  with  the relevant laws and regulations. Hence, we are committed to ensure  that  we  conduct  our  business  with  utmost  integrity and high standards of business ethics. This is in line with our core values.

## CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

To do so, our compliance department will take steps to assess the implications of any updates of regulations to Operational &amp; Technology Risk Committee ('OPTECH') every 2 months and  to HODs  quarterly. They  are also responsible for communicating  new  regulations  or changes  to existing regulations to the relevant HODs within 3 working days. The HODs and Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') are required to sign  off  a  semi-annual  Regulatory  Requirements  and  SelfAssessment ('RRSA') checklist. To stay relevant, SFL ensures that  our  compliance  department  receives  email  alerts  from MAS  and  other  regulatory  bodies  for  latest  updates  and disseminate the information to relevant departments within 3 working days.

Next,  we  have  in  place  a  Compliance  Risk  Management Framework. It consists of the objective for the management of  compliance  risk,  governance  and  oversight  structure, roles  and  responsibilities  as  well  as  the  compliance  risk management process. The purpose of this framework is to serve  as  a  guide  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  Management, Compliance Department and all employees on the key areas to note when dealing with compliance risks.

We then perform a quarterly review of scripless shareholders to monitor any non-disclosure of shareholding or transactions by  our  employees.  An  internal  guideline  is  in  place,  which prohibits  staff  from  dealing  in  the  Company's  securities during the period commencing one month before the date of announcement of half yearly and full year financial results. In 2020, all staff has complied with the guideline. In addition, an  Enterprise  Wide  Risk  Assessment  ('EWRA')  for  AML  is conducted annually.

We  have  successfully  achieved  our  targeted  performance for  2020  of  zero  cases  of  significant  fines  or  non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations  in  the  social  and  economic  area.  We  are  also pleased  to  announce  that  100%  of  our  employees  were proactive in attending trainings related to compliance, AML and CFT. We aim to maintain this good performance and to ensure that all employees attend compliance trainings in the following year.

## Anti-corruption

## [GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 205-3]

Corruption is a considerable obstacle to economic and social development of the Company and at SFL, we do not tolerate any forms of corruption. As a form of deterrence, we have put  in  place  several  anti-corruption  policies,  available  on the  Company's  general  online  drive  for  all  staff  to  access. These include HR Policy, Whistleblowing Policy, Fraud Policy, Interested  Party  Transactions  ('IPT')  Policy,  Related  Party Transactions ('RPT') Policy as well as Policy and Guidelines on  AML  and  CFT.  These  policies  are  reviewed  regularly  to ensure they are always up to date.

It is compulsory for new joiners to attend a AML/CFT training within 6 months of joining the Company. New joiners are also required to read and familiarise themselves with the Fraud, Whistleblowing, IPT and RPT policies of the Company. SFL also engages an external consultant every 2 years to train all staff  about new and recent developments in AML/CFT. SFL provides an alternative channel for whistleblowers to lodge a report of improper conduct in the Company on a confidential basis as well as guidance for establishing, implementing and managing whistle blower protection programme.

In  2020,  we  have  achieved  our  goal  of  zero  incidents  of corruption, fraud, whistle blowing, improper interested party  transactions  or  related  party  transactions,  anti-money laundering  and  countering  the  financing  of  terrorism  that resulted in legal action. There were also no incidents in which employees  were  dismissed  or  disciplined  for  corruption and  zero  incidents  where  contracts  with  business  partners were  terminated  or  not  renewed  due  to  violations  related to  corruption.  In  addition,  we  were  not  faced  with  any public legal cases regarding corruption brought against the Company or our employees during the reporting period. SFL maintains zero tolerance for knowingly breaching regulations on  anti-money  laundering  and  countering  the  financing  of terrorism.  We  had  zero  incidents  of  knowingly  on-boarding high  risk  customers  without  first  performing  the  necessary enhanced due diligence measures.

We plan to maintain this performance by investing in training as well  as  creating  awareness  on  the  repercussions  of corruption through our regular review and enhancement of anti-corruption policies.

## LOOKING AHEAD

We continue to stay committed in our sustainability journey and  will actively  take  into  account  considerations  from our  stakeholders  and  industry  trends  when  reviewing  and identifying key sustainability issues. Secondly, we will continue to  embed  sustainability  into  our  strategy  and  operations to  further  enhance performance. This will be done through reviewing existing policies and setting in place processes to monitor their effectiveness.

Following  the  changing  nature  and  development  of  the COVID-19  pandemic,  we  expect  that  the  impact  on  our business and sustainability journey will keep evolving. Therefore,  SFL  will  continue  to  tailor  our  operations  and strategies  to  remain  relevant  in  the  COVID-19  impacted economy. SFL will continue to share our efforts and performance  on  sustainability  with  our  stakeholders  on  an annual basis.

Singapura Finance Ltd (the 'Company') is committed to achieving and maintaining high standards of corporate governance so as to ensure greater transparency, accountability, and maximisation of long-term shareholder value.

In  compliance with Listing Rule 710 of the Listing Manual of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited ('SGX-ST Listing Manual'), this report outlines the Company's corporate governance practices which are in line with the principles and provisions set out in the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 (the 'Code') during the financial year ended 31 December 2020 ('FY2020'). Where there is any material deviation from the Code, the Company's position in respect of such differences is explained in this report.

## BOARD MATTERS

## Principle  1:    The  company  is  headed  by  an  effective  Board  which  is  collectively  responsible  and  works  with Management for the long-term success of the company.

## Role of the Board

The  Board  is  collectively  responsible  for  providing  overall  strategy  and  direction  to  Management  in  order  to  achieve sustainable and successful performance for the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'Group').

The principal functions of the Board are to:

- l Provide entrepreneurial leadership, set strategic aims and ensure that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Company to meet its objectives.
- l Establish a framework of prudent and effective controls which enables risks to be assessed and managed, including safeguarding of shareholders' interests and the Company's assets.
- l Consider and approve key changes to the organisational structure of the Company.
- l Approve the nominations and re-election of Directors to the Board.
- l Review Management's performance.
- l Identify the key stakeholder groups and recognise that their perceptions affect the Company's reputation.
- l Set the Company's values and standards (including ethical standards) and ensure that obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders are understood and met.
- l Consider sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation.
- l Monitor and review the Group's financial performance.
- l Assume responsibility for corporate governance.

All Directors objectively discharge their duties and responsibilities at all times as fiduciaries in the interests of the Company. Each Director is expected to act in good faith and in the best interests of the Company in the discharge of his or her duties and exercise of his or her powers as a Director. Directors facing conflicts of interest recuse themselves from discussions and decisions involving the issues of conflict.

## Board Committees

To ensure that specific issues are subject to in-depth and timely review, certain functions have been delegated to various Board Committees, which would submit its recommendations or decisions to the Board. The six Board Committees are the Executive Committee ('EXCO'), Digitalization Committee ('DC'), Nominating Committee ('NC'), Remuneration Committee ('RC'),  Risk  Management Committee ('RMC'), Audit Committee ('AC') and which are formed with clear written terms of reference approved by the Board, setting out their compositions, authorities and duties, including reporting back to the Board.

The EXCO comprises three members, namely, Mr Teo Chiang Long (Executive Chairman), Mr Teoh Eng Hong (Independent Non-Executive Director) and Mr Jamie Teo Miang Yeow (Executive Director &amp; Chief Executive Officer ('CEO')). The EXCO acts on behalf of the Board in supervising the management of the Company's business and affairs, in particular, the granting of  loans,  guarantees  or  credit  facilities  within  the  authority  limits  delegated  by  the  Board,  and  approving  new  product proposals.  Unanimous  decision  by  EXCO  Members  is  required  for  a  resolution  to  be  effective,  which  is  passed  through circulation in writing.

The  DC  was  established  on  12  August  2020.  It  comprises  four  members  namely  Mr  Jamie  Teo  Miang  Yeow  (Executive Director &amp; CEO), two Independent Non-Executive Directors i.e. Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang and Mr  Melvin  Yeo  (Head,  Information  Services).  Mr  Jamie  Teo  Miang  Yeow  chairs  the  DC.  Mr  Teo  Chiang  Long  (Executive Chairman) is the advisor to the DC. The DC provides the governance over the direction and ongoing progress of the digital strategy of the Company and ensuring that they are consistent with the Company's vision and values.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The compositions and key functions of the other four committees are described in the other relevant sections of this report.

- l NC (Principle 4)
- l RC (Principle 6)
- l RMC (Principle 9)
- l AC (Principle 10)

## Board Meetings and Attendance

Regular Board and Board Committee meetings are held. The Board meets at least four times a year. Additional meetings are  held  as  and  when  circumstances  warrant.  The  Company's  Constitution  provides  that  Board  meetings  may  be  held via  teleconferencing.  Due  to  COVID-19,  most  of  the  Board  and  Board  Committee  meetings  in  FY2020  were  held  via teleconferencing.

The Board has written terms of reference which clearly set out its authority and duties. The Board reviews and approves the strategic  plans,  annual  budget,  key  operational  issues,  quarterly  and  yearly  financial  announcements  and  statutory  financial statements and reviews the financial performance of the Group. Following amendments to Rule 705(2) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual which took effect from 7 February 2020, the Company had ceased to release its financial statements on a quarterly basis and is now releasing its financial statements on a semi-annual basis. Nevertheless, the Board and AC continue to meet on a quarterly basis.

Other material matters which are subject to the Board's approval include:

- l Major loan proposals;
- l Major transactions, acquisitions, disposals, investments and funding decisions;
- l Corporate or financial restructuring;
- l Share issuances and dividend payment to shareholders;
- l Interested person transactions; and
- l Risk management strategies.

The Directors may at any time request further explanations, briefings or informal discussions on any aspect of the Company's operations.

The attendances of the Directors at Board and Board Committee meetings during FY2020 are as follows:

## Training of Directors

A  formal  letter  is  sent  to  newly  appointed  Directors  upon  their  appointment  explaining  their  duties  and  obligations as  Directors.  New  Directors  receive  appropriate  training  and  briefing  in  areas  such  as  accounting,  legal,  the  roles  and responsibilities of his or her duties as a Director of a listed company and how to discharge those duties when they are first appointed to the Board. There is also an orientation programme to ensure that incoming Directors are familiar with the Company's business and governance practices.

Under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, a new Director who has no prior experience as a director of a company listed on the SGX-ST must undergo training in the roles and responsibilities of a director of a company listed on the SGX-ST as prescribed by the SGX-ST within one year from the date of his appointment. The Company did not appoint any new Director in FY2020.

The  Directors  are  also  provided  with  updates  and/or  briefings  from  time  to  time  by  professional  advisers,  auditors,  the Management and  the  Company  Secretary  in  areas  such  as  directors'  duties  and  responsibilities,  corporate  governance practices, relevant legislations and regulations, risk management and financial reporting standards.

The Directors  are  encouraged  to  attend  seminars,  workshops  and  receive  training  in  areas  such  as  directors'  duties  and responsibilities,  changes  in  regulations  and  regulatory  framework  (including  financial  reporting  standards  and  the  SGX-ST Listing Manual) which are relevant to the Company's business and operations, so as to enable them to perform effectively as Directors.  The Company arranges and funds the training of Directors.

As  part  of  the  Board's  continuous  development  programme  for  the  year,  the  Board  attended  a  cybersecurity  seminar conducted by Ernst &amp; Young LLP Singapore and an anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism training by an external trainer to keep abreast with the landscape, regulations and risk management of cybersecurity, data protection and AML/CFT. The Board and AC members were also briefed by the Company's external auditors on accounting standards updates during the year.

The NC has assessed and is satisfied that the training,  courses  and  seminars  attended  by  the  Directors  in  FY2020  have adequately fulfilled their purpose.

In addition to the training and briefing updates, Directors would also approach Management should they require any further information or clarification concerning the Company's operations.

## Complete, Adequate and Timely Information

All Directors have separate and independent access to Management at all times, and unrestricted access to the Company's records  and  information.  They  received  detailed  financial  and  operational  reports  from  Management  during  the  year  to enable them to carry out their duties. During FY2020, the Board also received regular updates from the Management on the impact of COVID-19 on the Company.

Prior  to  each  Board  and  Board  Committee meeting, the members are provided with the meeting agenda and the relevant papers submitted by Management, containing complete, adequate and timely information to enable full deliberation on the  issues  to  be  considered  at  the  meetings.  Such  information  includes  background  or  explanatory  information  relating to  matters  to  be  brought  before  the  Board  or  Board  Committee,  and  copies  of  disclosure  documents,  budgets  or  latest forecasts. In respect of budgets, any material variance between the projections and actual results are disclosed and explained. Management staff and the Company's auditors, who can provide additional insight to the matters for discussion, are also invited from time to time to attend such meetings.

## Company Secretary

The Directors have separate and independent access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary at all times. The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and is responsible for, among other things, ensuring that Board procedures are  observed  and  that  applicable  rules  and  regulations  are  complied  with.  The  Company  Secretary  acts  as  channel  of communication and information within the Board and its Board Committees and between Management and non-executive Directors.  The  Company  Secretary's  responsibilities  also  include  facilitating  orientation  and  assisting  with  professional development as required. Appointment and removal of the Company Secretary require the approval of the Board. Mr Tan Wee Sin was appointed as Company Secretary in place of Ms Ngiam May Ling with effect from 4 January 2021.

## Independent Professional Advice

Each Director has the right to seek independent legal and other professional advice, at the Company's expense, concerning any aspect of the Group's operations or undertakings in order to fulfil his duties and responsibilities as Director.

## Principle  2:    The  Board  has  an  appropriate  level  of  independence  and  diversity  of  thought  and  background  in  its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.

## Board Independence

The Board comprises nine Directors, all of whom, except for the Executive Chairman and the CEO, are non-executive and independent Directors. The seven independent Directors are Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang. The Company has no alternate directors on its Board.

Independent Directors make up the majority of the Board.  Every year, the NC determines the independence of each Director by taking into account the definition of an independent Director and the relevant provisions and listing rules under the Code and the SGX-ST Listing Manual respectively.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Under  the  Code,  an  independent  director  is  one  who  is  independent  in  conduct,  character  and  judgment,  and  has  no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers, that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director's independent business judgement in the best interests of the Company.

Under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, a director will not be independent if he is employed by the company or any of its related corporations  for  the  current  or  any  of  the  past  three  financial  years,  or,  if  he  has  any  immediate  family  member  who  is employed or has been employed by the company or any of its related corporations for the past three financial years, and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee of the company.

The above provisions in the Code and the listing rules in the SGX-ST Listing Manual do not apply to any of the independent Non-Executive Directors.

The NC takes into account the annual confirmation of independence completed by each independent Director. Independent Directors are required under the annual confirmation to critically assess their independence.

As non-executive members of the Board, the independent Directors do not exercise management functions in the Company. However, all the Directors have equal responsibility and make contributions towards the performance of the Group.

Based on Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual which will come into effect on 1 January 2022, a director who has been a director for an aggregate period of more than 9 years (whether commencing before or after listing) is not independent if his/her continued appointment as an independent director has not been sought and approved in separate resolutions by (A) all shareholders; and (B) all shareholders, excluding shareholders who also serve as the directors or the chief executive officer of the company, and associates of such directors and chief executive officers ('Two-Tier Voting') such resolutions to remain in  force  until  the  earlier  of  retirement  or  resignation  of  the  above  Directors;  or  the  conclusion  of  the  third  annual  general meeting of the Company following the passing of the resolution.

In view thereof, five of the independent Directors, namely, Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha who have served the Board for more than nine years from the date of their respective first appointments as a director will be seeking approval at the forthcoming AGM for their continued appointment as independent Directors via the Two-Tier Voting in separate resolutions.

The NC (with Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha each abstaining from deliberation on their continued appointment) and the Board have assessed the independence of each of these five Directors using a holistic approach and taking into account their respective contributions in terms of experience, expertise, professionalism, integrity,  objectivity  and  independent judgement in their engagement with all relevant parties, rather than solely  and  arbitrarily  on  basis  of  length  of  service  alone.  Having  performed  a  rigorous  review  of  their  independence,  the NC (with Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha each abstaining from  deliberation  on  their  continued  appointment)  and  the  Board  are  of  the  view  that  these  five  Directors  continue  to be  independent  notwithstanding  their  length  of  service,  because  each  of  them  has  consistently  demonstrated  strong independence of judgment and integrity of character in discharging his or her respective responsibilities. All the Independent Directors are sitting in the respective Board Committees which require special skillset and experience and their contribution are  still  required  at  the  Committees  level.  Their  vast  experience  enable  them  to  provide  the  Board  and  the  various  Board Committees on which they serve, with pertinent experience and competence to facilitate sound decision-making especially with the challenges brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Their length of service does not in any way interfere with their exercise of independent judgement nor hinder their ability to act in the best interests of the Company. Additionally, they have fulfilled the definition of Independent Directors of the SGX-ST Listing Rules and the Code. The Board trust that they are able to continue to discharge their duties independently with integrity and competency.

Upon  passing  the  Two-Tier  Voting  Resolutions  (the  'Ordinary  Resolutions')  at  the  forthcoming  AGM,  the  continued appointment of each of Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng and Mdm Tan Hui Keng Martha as an Independent Director of the Company shall continue in force until the earlier of: (i) the retirement or resignation of the Independent Director as a Director; or (ii) the conclusion of the third AGM of the Company following the passing of these Ordinary Resolutions.

Any of the Independent Director(s) who does/do not passed the Ordinary Resolutions at the forthcoming AGM will no longer be independent and shall continue as non-independent director(s) of the Company.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Rule  210(5)(c)  of  the  SGX-ST  Listing  Rules,  which  will  come  into  effect  on  1  January  2022,  Independent  Directors  must comprise of at least one-third of the Board and the Provision 2.2 of the Code provides that Independent Directors to make up a majority of the Board where the Chairman is not independent. In the event that the Ordinary Resolution(s) for the continued appointment of the Independent Director(s) is/are not passed at the forthcoming AGM which renders the Company unable to  meet  these  requirements,  the  Company shall  endeavour to fill  the  vacancy(ies)  in  the  Board  to  comply  with  the  Rules 210(5)(c) and 704(8) of the SGX-ST Listing Rules and the Provision 2.2 of the Code. The Company shall endeavour to fill the vacancy(ies) within two months, but in any case not later than three months.

The Board considers its independent non-executive Directors to be of significant influence and their views to be of sufficient weight such that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the Board's decision-making processes.

## Board Composition

Members of the Board are prominent business leaders and professionals with financial, banking and business management backgrounds. Their diverse corporate experiences as a group provide core competencies relevant to the Group's business, and an appropriate balance of skills, experience, gender and knowledge of the Company. The Board, through the NC, has reviewed its composition, and is satisfied that the size of the Board is appropriate and adequate for effective decision-making having regard to its present scale of operations. Details of the Directors' professional qualifications, working experience, and other directorships and principal commitments/appointments can be found on pages 4 to 6.

The  Board's  non-executive  Directors  constructively  challenge,  help  develop  proposals  on  strategy,  and  review  the performance  of  Management  in  meeting  agreed  goals  and  objectives  and  monitor  the  reporting  of  performance.  The Independent Directors, led by the Lead Independent Director, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon meet on a need basis without the presence of Management, in order to facilitate a more effective check on Management. In the event that such meetings are convened, the Lead Independent Director would provide feedback to the Executive Chairman after the meetings. No meeting of the Independent Directors was convened in FY2020.

## Board Diversity

While the Board has not adopted a formal board diversity policy, it recognises that a diverse Board is an important element which will better support the Company's achievement of its strategic objectives for sustainable development by enhancing the  decision-making  process  of  the  Board  through  the  perspectives  derived  from  the  various  skills,  business  experience, industry discipline, gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical background and nationalities, tenure of service and other distinguishing qualities of the Directors

The Board has two female members, and Directors with ages ranging from mid-40s to more than 70 years old, who have served  on  the  Board  for  different  tenures.  The  members  of  the  Board  with  their  combined  business,  management  and professional  experience,  knowledge  and  expertise,  provide  the  core  competencies  to  allow  for  diverse  and  objective perspectives on the Group's business and direction. Further information on the individual Directors' background, experience and skills can be found in the 'Board of Directors' section in the Annual Report 2020.

## Principle 3:  There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

The offices of the Executive Chairman and the CEO are held by separate individuals. Mr Teo Chiang Long is the Executive Chairman of the Company, while his son, Mr Jamie Teo Miang Yeow is the CEO.

As the Executive Chairman and the CEO are immediate family members and are both part of the executive management team, the NC has appointed Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, the Chairman of the NC and a member of both the AC and RC, as the Lead Independent Director mainly to serve as the principal liaison on Board issues between the non-executive Directors and the Executive Chairman and to address any queries and shareholders' concerns which contact through the normal channels of the Executive Directors has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate. Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon was appointed as the Deputy Board Chairman on 11 March 2020.

There  is  a  clear  division  of  responsibilities  between  the  Executive  Chairman  and  the  CEO,  which  are  set  out  in  writing and  agreed  by  the  Board.  The  Executive  Chairman  leads  the  Board  to  monitor  and  review  the  general  progress  and long-term development of the Company. He ensures the members of the Board receive accurate, timely and clear information in  particular  about  the  Company's  performance,  to  enable  the  Board  to  make  sound  decisions,  monitor  effectively  and provide advice to promote the success of the Company. He also encourages constructive relations between the Board and Management, and between the executive and non-executive Directors. The CEO manages the daily operations of the Group and implements the Board's policies and decisions.

Principle  4:    The  Board  has  a  formal  and  transparent  process  for  the  appointment  and  re-appointment  of  directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the Board.

## Nominating Committee

The  NC  comprises  six  members,  all  of  whom  are  independent  non-executive  Directors.  The  Chairman  of  the  NC  is Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Chairman) and the other members of the NC are Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang.

Based on its written terms of reference, the principal functions of the NC include:

- l Reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and making recommendations to the Board with regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary;
- l Identifying and nominating for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when they arise;
- l Determining annually, and if circumstances require, the independence of a Director;
- l Reviewing  the  ability  of  a  Director  to  adequately  carry  out  his  duties  as  Director  when  he  has  multiple  board representations;
- l Recommending to the  Board  the  re-election  by  shareholders  of  any  Director  under  the  'retirement  by  rotation' provisions in the Company's Constitution;
- l Assessing the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and its Board Committees; and
- l Reviewing the training and professional development programs for the Board.

None of the Directors has an alternate Director.  As a Director is expected to be able to commit time to the affairs of the Company, the NC will generally not support the appointment of an alternate Director.

## Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors

The  NC  identifies  and  interviews  short-listed  candidates  before  formally  considering  and  recommending  them  for appointment to the Board and where applicable, to the Board Committees.

The NC in reviewing and recommending to the Board any new Director appointment takes into consideration the current Board  size  and  its  mix,  the  competing  time  commitments  faced  by  Directors  with  multiple  Board  representations,  the additional skills and experience that will bolster the core competencies of the Board, the search process for the identification of  suitable  candidates  and  once  identified,  the  appropriate  knowledge,  experience  and  skills  of  the  candidates  who  in  its opinion,  are  fit  and  proper  and  qualified  for  office.  As  the  Company  is  a  finance  company  as  defined  under  the  Finance Companies Act, Chapter 108 of Singapore, all new appointments to the Board are subject to the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

## Re-appointment of Directors

Under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, all Directors are required to submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election. Article 97 of the Constitution requires one-third of the Directors, or the number nearest to but not less than one-third, to retire by rotation at every Annual General Meeting ('AGM'). These Directors may offer themselves for re-election, if eligible.

The NC reviews annually the nomination of the relevant Directors for re-election or re-appointments as well the independence of Directors. When considering the nomination of Directors for re-appointment, the NC takes into account their contribution to  the  effectiveness  of  the  Board  as  well  as  their  time  commitment  especially  for  Directors  who  have  multiple  board representations, and also reviews their independence.

## Succession Planning for the Board, the Board Chairman and Senior Management

The Board believes in carrying out succession planning for itself, the Board Chairman and the Senior Management team to  ensure  continuity  of  leadership.  Board  renewal  is  a  continuing  process  and  in  this  regard,  the  NC  reviews  annually  the composition of the Board and Committees, which includes size and mix, and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment  of  new  Directors,  whether  in  addition  to  the  existing  Board  members  or  as  replacement  of  retiring  Board members, with a view to identifying any gaps in the Board's skills set taking into account the Group's business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding any resignation or retirement of any Director given the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board.

## Directors' Time Commitment

Where a Director has multiple Board representations, the NC also considers if such a Director is able to adequately carry out his/her responsibilities as a Director of the Company. In this regard, the Board has set a general guideline that the maximum number of listed company board representations which a Director may hold (including representation on the Company's Board) should not be more than seven. These guidelines were established following the careful assessment by the NC and the Board after taking into consideration the scope and complexity of the Company's business. Where there is a potential conflict of interest in accepting a new appointment on the board of other listed companies, assessment through the NC and the approval of the Board are required prior to accepting that appointment.

All  Directors  have  met  the  requirements  under  the  guidelines.  The  Board  is  satisfied  that  each  Director  has  committed sufficient  time  to  the  Company  and  has  contributed  meaningfully  to  the  Company.  Details  of  the  Directors'  professional qualifications,  working  experience,  and  other  directorships  and  principal  commitments/appointments  can  be  found  on pages 4 to 6.

Principle 5:  The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

## Board Evaluation Process

The  Company  has  in  place  a  formal  process  for  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  Board  as  a  whole,  the  Board Committees  and  the  contribution  by  each  Director  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  Board.  The  NC  assesses  the  Board's performance  as  a  whole  annually  using  objective  and  appropriate  quantitative  and  qualitative  criteria  which  were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. When assessing the overall Board performance, the NC takes into consideration  the  feedback  from  individual  Directors  on  areas  relating  to  the  Board's  competencies  and  effectiveness. The results of the overall evaluation of the Board by the NC including its recommendations for improvements, if any, are presented to the Board.

The NC assesses the performance of all the Board Committees with the assistance of self-assessment checklists completed by each of the Board Committees.

The annual evaluation process for each individual Director's performance comprises three parts: (a) background information concerning the Director including his attendance records at Board and Board Committee meetings; (b) questionnaire for completion by each individual Board member; and (c) the NC's evaluation based on certain assessment parameters. The questionnaires and the assessment parameters were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. The completed questionnaires are then reviewed by the NC before the NC completes its evaluation of the individual Directors.

The results of the individual evaluation of each of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Board Chairman, to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Board Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the re-appointment and re-election of retiring Directors. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board.

## Board Evaluation Criteria

The qualitative  criteria  are  set  out  in  a  questionnaire  covering  three  main  areas  relating  to  Board  composition,  roles  and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information.

The quantitative criteria used to evaluate the overall Board performance comprises performance indicators which include a comparison of the Company's performance for the financial period under review against the performance of the Company and  industry  peers  for  the  corresponding  period  over  the  past  three  years  and  the  longer-term  indicators  such  as  the Company's total shareholder return over a five-year period.

## Board Committee Evaluation Criteria

The qualitative criteria are set out in a questionnaire covering areas relating to composition of the Board Committee, its roles and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information.

## Individual Director Evaluation Criteria

Factors taken into account in the assessment of a Director's performance include his abilities and competencies, his objectivity and the level of participation at Board and Board Committee meetings including his contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Company.

## REMUNERATION MATTERS

Principle  6:    The  Board  has  a  formal  and  transparent  procedure  for  developing  policies  on  director  and  executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors and key management personnel.  No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

## RC Composition and Role

The RC comprises six members, all of whom are independent non-executive Directors. The Chairman of the RC is Mr Phua Bah Lee and the other members of the RC are Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang.

Based on the written terms of reference approved by the Board, the principal functions of the RC are to:

- l Review and submit to the Board a framework of remuneration policies for Directors and key management personnel ('KMP') as defined in the Code;
- l Review and submit to the Board the specific remuneration packages and terms of employment of each Director and KMP, covering all aspects of remuneration including but not limited to Directors' fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options and benefits-in-kind; and
- l Review and submit to the Board the setting up of share option schemes or long-term incentive schemes.

The remuneration packages of executive Directors and KMP are approved by the Board upon recommendations by the RC. The Executive Chairman and the CEO do not participate in meetings to discuss their compensation packages. The two executive Directors and all KMP are on service contracts with fixed appointment periods. The RC reviews the service contracts of Executive Directors and KMP to ensure that they do not contain onerous removal clauses.

There  are  no  contractual  provisions  to  allow  the  Company  to  reclaim  incentive  components  of  remuneration  from  the executive Directors and KMP in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial statements, or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Company. The RC is of the view that such claw back provisions are not necessary because the variable components of their remuneration packages are moderate.

The RC may seek expert advice from external consultants whenever required. No external consultant was engaged in FY2020 to provide remuneration advice.

Principle  7:    The  level  and  structure  of  remuneration  of  the  Board  and  key  management  personnel  are  appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the company, taking into account the strategic objectives of the company.

## Remuneration Policy of Directors and Key Management Personnel ('KMP')

The Group's remuneration policy is to provide compensation packages at market rates which reward successful performance and attract, retain and motivate Directors and managers.

The compensation packages for executive Directors and KMP comprise a fixed component (in the form of a base salary and fixed allowances), a variable component (comprising short-term incentives in the form of year-end and variable bonuses and benefits-in-kind, where applicable). The variable components take into account, amongst other factors, the executive Directors' and KMP's performance, and the Company's performance and industry practices.

In determining the variable incentives for an executive Director and a KMP, his/her individual performance and contribution is  taken  into  consideration  together  with  the  competitive  market  practices  and  information  gathered  from  market  surveys conducted by the Company's Human Resources department. This is then reviewed along with the Company's performance, taking  into  consideration  specific  indicators  tracked  over  time  which  align  with  shareholders'  interest,  risk  policies  of  the Company which promote the long-term success of the Company. Besides profitability, the quality of the Company's core business is also taken into account with the monitoring of the size and robustness of its loan assets and the level of nonperforming loans.  Based on its assessment, the RC believes that the performance conditions used in determining the variable components of executive Director and KMP have been met.

Both executive and non-executive Directors receive Directors' fees which are subject to approval by shareholders. When reviewing  the  structure  and  level  of  Directors'  fees,  the  RC  takes  into  consideration  the  Directors'  respective  roles  and responsibilities  in  the  Board  and  Board  Committees,  effort  and  time  spent,  and  changes  in  the  business,  corporate governance practices and regulatory rules. The RC also compares the Company's fee structure against industry practices and  ensures  that  the  non-executive  Directors  are  not  over-compensated  to  the  extent  that  their  independence  may  be compromised. Other factors taken into consideration in the fee review includes frequency of Board and Board Committee meetings, corporate performance for the financial year under review as well as the corporate and economic outlook in the new financial year, and the interval since the last fee review. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.

There are no schemes to encourage non-executive Directors to hold shares in the company so as to better align the interests of such non-executive Directors with the interests of shareholders. However, the Company does not discourage the Directors from holding shares in the Company.

Staff  retirement  gratuity  is  the  only  long-term  incentive  scheme.  Staff  (including  executive  Director  and  KMP)  who  are employed before 28 December 2002 are entitled to the staff retirement gratuity if they have worked for at least 12 continuous years  prior  to  retirement.  The  Company  does  not  offer  shares  or  grant  options  with  vesting  period  or  employees  share scheme to its Directors and staff.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Principle 8:  The company is transparent on its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration, and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation.

## Notes:

(a) These relate to provision for long-term incentive scheme, staff retirement gratuity. No staff retirement gratuity and termination benefits were paid to any Directors during FY2020.

(b) These fees comprise Directors' fees for FY2020 which are subject to approval by shareholders as a lump sum at the forthcoming AGM.

The Code recommends that the Company should fully disclose the remuneration of each individual Director and the CEO on a named basis. The Board is of the view that such disclosure would not be in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders, and that the details disclosed in the table above as well as note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements provides an appropriate balance between detailed disclosure and confidentiality in the sensitive area of remuneration. In arriving  at  its  decision,  the  Board  also  took  into  consideration  the  competitive  business  environment  in  which  the  Group operates, and the negative impact such disclosure may have on the Group.

## Remuneration of Key Management Personnel (not being a Director or CEO)

The Code recommends that the Company should name and disclose the remuneration of at least the top five KMP (who are not Directors or the CEO) in bands of $250,000/-. The remuneration of every KMP in the Company is below $250,000/-. In  addition,  the  Company  should  also  disclose  in  aggregate  the  total  remuneration  paid  to  these  KMP.  As  the  number of  KMP of the Company is small, the Board is of the view that disclosure of the total remuneration of the KMP would be disadvantageous to the Group's business interests, given the prevailing highly competitive industry conditions. Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements provides an appropriate balance between detailed disclosure and confidentiality in the sensitive area of remuneration.

## Remuneration of Immediate Family Member of a Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder

The Code also recommends disclosure of the name and remuneration of employees who are immediate family members of a Director, the CEO or a substantial shareholder of the Company, whose remuneration exceeds $100,000/- during the year, in bands $100,000/-. Excluding the two Executive Directors, there were no employees of the Group who are immediate family members of a Director and whose remuneration exceeded $100,000/- during the financial year.

## ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

Principle  9:    The  Board  is  responsible  for  the  governance  of  risk  and  ensures  that  Management  maintains  a  sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

## Accountability of Board and Management

The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility to ensure accurate financial reporting for the Group.

The Board provides shareholders with semi-annual and annual financial results. In presenting these statements, the Board aims to provide shareholders with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance and position with a commentary at the date of announcement of the competitive conditions within the industry in which it operates.

Management  provides  all  Directors  periodically  with  accounts  and  reports  on  the  Group's  financial  performance  and commentaries on the competitive conditions within the industry in which the Group operates, which are reviewed by the Board at each Board meeting prior to release of the announcements on the semi-annual and full-year results of the Group in accordance with the regulatory requirements. Periodic reports covering the Group's financial performance are also provided to  all  Directors.  Apart  from  the  periodic  updates  provided  by  Management,  the  Directors  may  at  any  time  seek  further information from, and discuss with, Management on the Group's operations and performance.

## Risk Management

The Board is fully committed to the implementation of sound risk management policies and practices, which are aligned to the Group's overall business strategy and objectives. The Board determines the type and level of business risks that the Group undertakes and, at least annually, reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls.

The Risk  Management Committee ('RMC') assists the Board in overseeing risk governance in the Group's business and operations and ensuring that Management maintains a robust risk management framework with strong internal controls to safeguard shareholders' interests and the Group's assets.

The RMC comprises six members. They are independent non-executive Directors Mr Teoh Eng Hong (Chairman), Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, Mr William Ho Ah Seng, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang, and executive Director and CEO, Mr Jamie Teo Miang Yeow. To enhance communications between the AC and the RMC, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang are members of both committees.

Based on its written terms of reference, the principal functions of the RMC include:

- l Overseeing and advising the Board on the Group's risk appetite, risk strategy and risk exposure.
- l Reviewing  and  guiding  Management  in  the  formulation  of  the  Group's  risk  policies  and  in  the  execution  of  risk assessment processes and mitigation strategies.
- l Monitoring and managing the risk exposures of the Group.
- l Reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's risk management system.

The RMC has, in turn, appointed the Credit Control Committee, Credit Portfolio Committee, Asset-Liability Committee and Operational &amp; Technology Risk Committee to assist in fulfilling its roles.

The key risks of the Group include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational and technology risk and compliance risk.

Risk  management is an ongoing process. Continuous efforts are being made to ensure that the Group's risk management system and processes are in line with industry best practices.

## Credit Risk

Counter-party  risk  or  Credit  risk  is  the  risk  arising  from  the  uncertainty  of  an  obligor's  ability  to  perform  its  contractual obligations.  The Group's credit risk primarily stems from lending activities.

The two management committees assisting in the management of credit risk are the Credit Control Committee and Credit Portfolio Committee.

The Credit Control Committee ('CCC') reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions.

The  Credit  Portfolio  Committee  ('CPC')  manages  risk  on  a  portfolio-wide  basis  and  recommends  alternative  portfolio strategies, analyses the results of portfolio management actions, and develops portfolio limits for each portfolio segment for approval by the RMC. The CPC recommends the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, credit risk policies and manuals for approval by the RMC.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Risk  parameters  for  accepting  credit  risk  are  clearly  defined  and  are  supported  by  written  policies  and  processes  in  the Lending Guidelines to ensure that the Group maintains a well-diversified and high-quality loan portfolio.

The credit control functions ensure that credit risks are closely monitored and managed in compliance with the Group's credit policies and guidelines.

Credit reviews are carried out regularly to proactively identify and address potential weakness in the credit process and to pre-empt any unexpected deterioration in credit quality.

Credit stress tests framework is in place to analyse the impact of plausible adverse scenarios on the Group's loan portfolio.

The Group addresses credit concentration risk by setting and monitoring credit portfolio and industry mix limits on a regular basis.

Continuous efforts are being made to further enhance the Group's credit risk management processes.

The SFRS(I) 9 Committee ('SC') supports the Board and the AC in achieving compliance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) 9 Financial Instruments ('SFRS(I)9') which came into effect from 1 January 2018. SFRS(I) 9 requires, amongst others, an expected credit loss ('ECL') model for calculating impairment of financial assets.

The SC works closely with CPC and CCC to ensure that the Group has appropriate credit risk practices, including an effective system  of  internal  control,  to  consistently  determine  adequate  allowances  in  accordance  with  the  Group's  policies  and procedures relating to impairment allowances and applicable accounting framework under SFRS(I)9. The SC also reviews and recommends updates to the Governance &amp; Control Framework of ECL Model as well as the Impairment Allowance Policy at least on an annual basis. Any material changes to the ECL framework, methodology and policies are reviewed by SC before recommendation to the AC for concurrence and approval.

## Market Risk

Market risk encompasses price and interest rate risk, which are inherent in the ordinary course of the Group's business. Market risk refers to the risk to the Group resulting from movements in market prices, in particular, changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity prices.

The Asset-Liability Committee ('ALCO') manages the balance sheet to achieve an optimal balance between risk and reward with regards to structural interest rate risk, and liquidity and funding risk. ALCO also oversees the investment portfolio of the Company, reviews and recommends the limits of the Company's investments for approval by RMC as well as approves policies and strategies regarding these investments.

The Group has a comprehensive set of policies and monitoring system in place for the management of market risk. This includes limits  for  funding,  maturity,  and  re-pricing  gaps  between  assets  and  liabilities.  An  additional  measure  used  by  the Group for the interest rate sensitive investments is Present Value of a Basis Point ('PV01'), which measures the change in value of the interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a parallel increase of one basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve.

The Company's investment portfolio mainly consists of Singapore Government Securities and MAS Bills for the maintenance of regulatory minimum liquid assets purposes.

The Group uses an Asset Liability Management System to enhance its capabilities for balance sheet and liquidity simulation; and scenario analysis. Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis can now be performed under various interest rate scenarios using simulation modelling.

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk of the Group being unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring unacceptable costs or losses through fund raising and assets liquidation. It could be a result of the inability of the Group to  manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources and the failure to recognise or address changes in market conditions that affect the institution's ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. The Group maintains sufficient  liquidity  to  fund  its  day-to-day  operations,  including  customers'  demands  for  loan  drawdowns,  as  well  as  any unanticipated cash withdrawals.

The Group has a comprehensive monitoring system in place for the management of liquidity risk. This includes limits for funding &amp; liquidity gaps, deposit analysis and minimum liquid asset ratio.

Liquidity  policies,  procedures  and  limits  are  in  place  to  ensure  effective  liquidity  risk  management  and  compliance  with  all regulatory requirements.

A robust liquidity stress test framework is in place to assess and plan for the impact of various scenarios which may put the Company's liquidity at risk.

The ALCO manages the liquidity and funding risk to determine the appropriate levels of liquidity and ensures that funding costs are managed effectively, and reviews stress tests &amp; contingency funding plans for liquidity crises situations.

## Operational and Technology Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Technology risk is any risk related to information technology and information security.

The  Operational  and  Technology  Risk  Committee  ('OPTECH')  supports  the  RMC  in  its  handling  of  operational  and technology  risk.  The  OPTECH  recommends  the  operational  and  technology  risk  management  framework,  policies  and procedures, and strategies to mitigate risks and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation risk processes and information flows.

To pro-actively manage operational risk, each department undertakes regular operational risk and control self-assessments which  involve  identifying  and  assessing  inherent  risks,  as  well  as  assessing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  to  mitigate  the identified  risks.  Where  necessary,  action  plans  are  formulated  based  on  the  severity  of  the  assessed  residual  risk  after considering the mitigating controls. In addition, the Internal Audit function provides the assurance by conducting audits to assess the effectiveness of internal controls and report it to Management and the AC.

The OPTECH oversees the overall outsourcing function for the Company and ensures the risk management of outsourcing arrangements is in compliance with MAS Guidelines on Outsourcing, especially for material outsourcing arrangements

All  departments regularly review its  own Business Impact Analysis and Disaster Recovery Plan and Management provides an attestation to the RMC on the state of readiness for the Company's business continuity management process, extent of alignment to MAS guidelines and declaration of residual risk.

Technology risk is  managed in accordance to a Technology Risk Management Framework (which covers risk governance, identification, monitoring, assessment, mitigation and reporting), supported by a set of information technology policies and standards, control processes and risk mitigation programs in alignment to MAS guidelines.

## Compliance risk

Compliance risk is the risk of impairment to the Group's ability to successfully conduct its business as a result of any failure to  comply with applicable regulatory requirements. The Compliance Department is responsible for the Group's satisfactory compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and internal policies, including applicable rules and policies on antimoney laundering and counter financing of terrorism.

The Compliance Department is an independent function within the organisation which provides support such as carrying out independent checks upon implementation of new or changes in policies and procedures, as well as providing advice on regulatory requirements to relevant departments.

## Internal Controls

The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for the Group's system of internal controls.

The  Company's  external  auditors  carry  out  in  the  course  of  their  statutory  audit,  a  review  of  the  effectiveness  of  the Company's material internal controls focusing primarily on financial controls, to the extent set out in their audit plan. Material non-compliance and internal control weaknesses noted during their audit, and the external auditors' recommendation to address such non-compliance and weaknesses, are reported to the AC. Management, with the assistance of the internal auditors, follows up on external auditors' recommendations as part of its role in the review of the Company's internal control systems.

Besides  that,  all  business  units  perform  self-assessment  of  their  processes  to  evaluate  and  manage  the  adequacy  and effectiveness of their internal controls, as well as their level of compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The results of the evaluations are reviewed by Management.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Board has received assurances from the CEO, Financial Controller ('FC'), KMP and Heads of Department regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The Board has also received assurance  from  the  CEO  and  the  FC  that  as  at  31  December  2020,  the  Group's  financial  records  have  been  properly maintained, and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances.

Based on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by Management and various Board Committees and the assurances received from the CEO, FC, KMP and Heads of Department, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC and the RMC, is of the opinion that the Group's system of  internal  controls,  including  financial,  operational,  compliance  and  information  technology  controls,  and  risk  management systems were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2020 to address the risks which the Group considers relevant and material  to  its  operations.  No  material  weaknesses  in  the  Company's  internal  controls  and  risk  management  systems  were identified by the Board, the AC and the RMC in FY2020.

The Board notes that the system of internal controls provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.

## Principle 10:  The Board has an Audit Committee which discharges its duties objectively.

## AC Composition and Role

The AC comprises six members, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors. Mdm Tan Hui Keng, Martha chairs the AC. The other members of the AC are Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr Adam Tan Chin Han and Mr Terence Khoo Chi Siang. The Board considers that all the AC members, including the AC Chairman, have recent and relevant accounting or related financial management expertise or experience to discharge their duties as an AC member.

None of the AC members were previous partners or directors of the Company's existing external audit firm, KPMG LLP within the previous 2 years prior to their appointment to the AC, and none of the AC members have any financial interest in KPMG LLP either presently or within the previous 2 years prior to their appointment to the AC.

Based on its written terms of reference approved by the Board, the principal functions and activities of the AC during FY2020 include:

- l Reviewing related party and interested person transactions.

The AC keeps abreast of changes to accounting standards and issues which have a direct impact on financial statements during their engagement with the external and internal auditors. The AC meets with the external and internal auditors without the presence of Management at least twice during the year. The AC has explicit authority to investigate any matter within its terms of reference, full access to and co-operation of Management and the internal auditors and has full discretion to invite any Director or executive officer to attend its meetings.  The auditors, both internal and external, have unrestricted access to the AC.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

In  the  review  of  the  financial  statements,  the  AC  discussed  with  Management  the  accounting  principles  that  were  applied and their judgement of items that might affect the integrity of the financial statements. The AC also considered the clarity of disclosures on significant matters in the financial statements. Among other matters, the following key audit matters (KAMs) as reported by the external auditors for FY2020 on pages 50 to 51 were reviewed and discussed by the AC with Management and the external auditors:

| KAMs                                           | How the AC reviewed these matters and what decisions were made                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowance for impairment on loans and advances | The SFRS(I)9 Committee ('SC') as disclosed under 'Credit Risk' on pages 38 to 39, supports the AC and the Board of the Group in achieving compliance with SFRS(I) 9. The AC has reviewed the Group's ECL Model Governance and Framework and the Impairment Allowance Policy. The AC was satisfied with the governing procedures and controls that have been put in place. The AC has also discussed with the external auditors and was satisfied that the underlying assumptions and methodologies were reasonable and fulfilled the requirements of SFRS(I)9 based on the model validation performed by the external auditors. The AC has discussed with Management and the external auditors and was satisfied that the overall loan impairment allowances were reasonable and fair and has taken into consideration the impact of COVID-19. |

## External Auditors

The AC also noted and reviewed the nature and extent of the non-audit services provided to the Group by the external auditors.  The  AC  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  provision  of  such  non-audit  services  did  not  affect  the  independence  and objectivity  of  the  external  auditors.  For  details  of  the  fees  paid  to  the  external  auditors  in  respect  of  audit  and  non-audit services during FY2020, please refer to note 16 of the Notes to the Financial Statements on page 84.

The AC is satisfied that the external auditors has the requisite expertise and resources to perform their duties. Accordingly, the AC has nominated KPMG LLP for re-appointment as the external auditors at the forthcoming AGM. The external auditors have  confirmed  that  it  is  registered  with  the  Accounting  and  Corporate  Regulatory  Authority.  The  Company  is  thus  in compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of the Group's auditors.

## Internal Audits

The Group has a well-established internal audit function with formal procedures for the internal auditors to report their audit findings directly to the AC.

The annual internal audit plan is prepared in consultation with, but independent of Management, and submitted to the AC for approval.  The AC ensures that the internal audit function has appropriate standing within the Company. The internal auditors report directly to the AC on audit issues and the CEO on administrative matters. The findings and recommendations made by the internal auditors have been adequately followed through and implemented by Management in the financial year.  The AC participates in and approves the hiring, removal, evaluation and compensation of the internal audit function.  The internal auditors are given unfettered access to all company documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the AC.

Staffed  by  suitably  qualified  executives  with  relevant  qualifications  and  experience,  the  primary  role  of  the  internal audit  function  is  to  assist  the  Board  to  evaluate  the  reliability,  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  internal  controls  and  risk management processes of the Company. The AC reviews the adequacy of the internal audit function through a review of the internal  auditor's  programmes on a quarterly basis and ensures that the internal audit function has adequate resources and appropriate authority to perform its functions properly. In doing so, the AC takes into consideration the service level, attentiveness, professionalism and calibre of the assigned personnel who carried out the internal audit activities during the financial year. The AC is also responsible for approving the appointment, remuneration, evaluation, resignation or dismissal of the Head of Internal Audit Department.

In carrying out its function, our internal auditors are guided by the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by The Institute of Internal Auditors.

The internal auditors have unfettered access to all the Company's documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the AC.

The AC has appointed Ernst &amp; Young LLP (Singapore) to perform the internal audit functions for the Information Technology Services Department of the Group.

Based on its assessment, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the internal audit function was independent, effective and adequately resourced during FY2020.

The Group has a separate compliance function to help ensure adherence with applicable legislation, rules and regulations in the conduct of its business.

## Whistleblowing Policy

The Company has in place a whistleblowing policy which provides that employees of the Group may raise in confidence, any concerns on suspected breach or fraud, or possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or behaviour that may not be in compliance with the law and Code of Conduct of the Company, without fear of reprisals. The whistleblowing policy is reviewed by the AC and approved by the Board annually to ensure that it remains current and relevant. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken.

The whistleblowing policy is  accessible  to  all  employees  via  the  Company's  shared  drive.  Employees  may  report  via  the dedicated whistleblowing communication channel to the AC Chairman. There were no whistleblowing incident during FY2020.

## Interested Person Transactions

The Company has established policies and procedures on related party and interested persons transactions to ensure that such transactions are undertaken on an arm's length basis, on normal commercial terms consistent with the Company's usual business practices and policies, and are not prejudicial to the interest of the Company and its minority shareholders. The AC reviews all related party and interested persons transactions on a quarterly basis.

The interested person transactions and the aggregate value of interested person transactions disclosed as required under Rule 907 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual during FY2020 are as follows:

| Name of Interested Person   | Aggregate value of all interested person transactions during the financial year under review (excluding transactions less than $100,000 and transactions conducted under shareholders' mandate pursuant to Rule 920)   | Aggregate value of all interested person transactions conducted under shareholders' mandate pursuant to Rule 920 (excluding transactions less than $100,000)   |

The transaction above was carried out on normal commercial terms which are not prejudicial to the interest of the Company and its minority shareholders.

## Material Contracts

Save for the tenancy agreement entered into by the Company with High Luck Pte Ltd as disclosed in the preceding section entitled  'Interested  Person  Transactions',  there  were  no  other  material  contracts  entered  into  by  the  Group  involving  the interest of the CEO, any Director, or controlling shareholder, which are either still subsisting at the end of FY2020 or if not then subsisting, entered into since the end of the previous financial year.

## SHAREHOLDERS RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT

Principle 11:  The company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably in order to enable them to exercise shareholders' rights  and  have  the  opportunity  to  communicate  their  views  on  matters  affecting  the  company.  The  company  gives shareholders a balanced and understandable assessment of its performance, position and prospects.

## Fair and equitable treatment of shareholders

The Company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably. Shareholders are informed of any changes in the Company which are likely to materially affect the price or value of the Company's shares via SGXNET announcements on a timely basis.

## Conduct of Shareholder Meetings

The Board regards the AGM as a key opportunity to communicate directly with the shareholders, which include institutional and  retail  investors,  and  encourages  attendance  and  participation  in  dialogue.  The  notice  of  AGM  is  dispatched  to shareholders, together with explanatory notes on items of special business, at least 14 days before the meeting. The notice, first disseminated via SGXNET, is also published in newspapers.

The Company convened its shareholders meeting virtually in 2020 while adhering to the carious advisories and guidance issued by the authorities on holding meeting amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

As  permitted  under  the  COVID-19  (Temporary  Measures)  (Alternative  Arrangements  for  Companies,  Variable  Capital Companies, Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 2020, the Company will convene its 2021 AGM by electronic means  for the health and safety of our shareholders and staff. Shareholders will not be able to attend the AGM physically.

Alternative arrangements relating to attendance at the 2021 AGM via electronic means include arrangements by which the meeting can be electronically accessed where shareholders will be able to watch the proceedings of the meeting through a 'live' webcast via their mobile phones, tablets or computers or listen to these proceedings through a 'live' audio feed via telephone by pre-registering their attendance.

Prior to the AGM, shareholders may also submit questions related to the resolutions to be tabled for approval at the AGM. The Company will address substantial and relevant questions relating to the resolutions before the AGM via SGXNet and the Company's website. Shareholders will not be able to ask questions at the AGM 'live' during the webcast and the audio feed. The Company will, within one month after the date of the AGM, publish the minutes of the AGM on SGXNet and the Company's website, and the minutes will include the responses to the questions referred to above.

Shareholders will not be able to vote online on the resolutions to be tabled for approval at the AGM. Instead, if shareholders (whether individual or corporate) wish to exercise their votes, they must submit a proxy form to appoint the Chairman of the AGM to vote on their behalf. Separate resolutions on each distinct issue are tabled at the AGM. Detailed information on each resolution is provided in the explanatory notes to the notice of AGM in the Annual Report 2020.

Principle  12:    The  company  communicates  regularly  with  its  shareholders  and  facilitates  the  participation  of shareholders during general meeting and other dialogues to allow shareholders to communicate their views on various matters affecting the company.

## Regular, effective and fair communication with shareholders

The Company has in place an Investor Relations Policy which provides guidance on when and how the Company engages and  communicates  with  shareholders.  Enquiries  from  shareholders,  analysts  and  the  press  are  handled  by  specifically designated personnel in lieu of a dedicated investor relations team.

The  Company  endeavours  to  communicate  regularly  and  effectively  with  its  shareholders.  The  Company  announces  its half-year and full-year results within the mandatory period.

The Company does not practise selective disclosure. Material and price-sensitive announcements are released to the public via SGXNET and such information is also posted on the Company's website at www.singapurafinance.com.sg.

Shareholders  and  investors  may  provide  feedback  or  express  their  views  via  the  enquiry  or  feedback  platform  at  the Company's website.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Company has a dividend policy, which is set out below.

The Group aims to maintain a strong capital position to ensure market confidence, to support its on-going business and to  meet  the  expectations  of  depositors,  customers  and  investors  alike.  The  Company  is  also  required  to  comply  with regulatory standards of capital requirements through the maintenance of a minimum capital adequacy ratio at all times, and to transfer a requisite proportion of its annual net profit to the statutory reserve which is not available for distribution to shareholders. Our dividend policy aims to provide shareholders with sustainable dividend return over the long term by balancing growth with prudent capital management and subject to the profitability of the Group.

In a media release on 7 Aug 2020, MAS urged finance companies to cap their total dividends per share ('DPS') for FY2020 at  60%  of  FY2019's  level  and  encouraged  finance  companies  to  offer  shareholders  the  option  of  receiving  the  dividends to  be  paid  for  FY2020  in  scrip  in  lieu  of  cash.  The  dividend  restriction  is  a  pre-emptive  measure  to  bolster  the  finance companies' ability to continue to support the credit needs of businesses and consumers in the current business environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also balances the objective of capital conservation to sustain lending with the interests of shareholders who may rely on this income.

Subject to approval of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, in line with the Group's dividend policy and MAS recommendations, the Company is recommending proposing a first and final one-tier tax exempt dividend of 1.5 cents per share and no special dividend for FY2020 (FY2019: First and final one-tier tax exempt dividend of 2 cents per share and a special one-tier tax exempt dividend of 1.5 cents per share). The total distribution of 1.5 cents per share for the year will  amount to approximately $2.38 million. The dividend shall be paid in cash as the Company deemed that it is not costbeneficial to offer scrip dividend.

## MANAGING STAKEHOLDERS RELATIONSHIPS

## Principle 13:  The Board adopts an inclusive approach by considering and balancing the needs and interests of material stakeholders, as part of its overall responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the company are served.

The Board sets the tone from the top for matters such as values and standards (including ethical business practices) and brand reputation. It also oversees the Group's strategic direction and long-term sustainability.  Recognising that perceptions of key stakeholders can affect an organisation's reputation, the Executive Directors and Management actively identify and engage with key stakeholders of the Group, and updates and any relevant feedback received are communicated to the Board.

The Company recognises the importance in maintaining positive stakeholder relationships and adopts an inclusive approach in  the  management  and  engagement  of  its  stakeholders  -  namely  customers,  employees,  regulators,  shareholders  and communities. The Sustainability Report on page 12 of this Annual Report sets out the Company's approach to stakeholder engagement including key areas of focus and how it responds to stakeholder concern.

The  Company  maintains  a  corporate  website  at  www.singapurafinance.com.sg  to  communicate  and  engage  with  its stakeholders.

## ETHICAL STANDARDS

The Company manages its business according to the core values of integrity, performance excellence, teamwork, trust and respect to which staff subscribes to and are assessed on. The Company has an internal Code of Conduct which defines the Company's business principles and practices with respect to matters which may have ethical implications. Easily accessible to all employees via the Company's shared drive, it provides a framework for staff to observe the Company's principles such as  honesty,  integrity,  responsibility  and  accountability  at  all  levels  of  the  organisation  and  in  the  conduct  of  the  Company's business in their relationships with various stakeholders, including situations where there are potential conflict of interests.

In  line  with  the  Board's  commitment  to  maintain  high  ethical  standard,  the  Company  has  a  suite  of  corporate  policies  and procedures in place. This includes a comprehensive whistleblowing policy for employees of the Group to bring attention to the AC any concern, suspected breach or fraud, or activity or behaviour that may not be in compliance with the law and Code of Conduct of the Company.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## Internal Code on Dealing in Securities

| Allowance for ECL is viewed as a key audit matter as a result of the significance of the loans and advances to customers and inherent complexity in the Group's ECL model. The Group's loans and advances to customers represent 71% of its total assets. Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases: (i) 12-month ECLs for financial assets where credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk ('Stage 1 ECLs'); or (ii) Lifetime ECLs for financial assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition ('Stage 2 ECLs') or are credit impaired ('Stage 3 ECLs'). Significant judgement is required in the following areas including: l appropriateness of the methodology and parameters used in the ECL model; l identification of credit exposures which have exhibited a 'significant increase in credit risk' and l determination of relevant macroeconomic factors for incorporation into the model. In 2020, the resulting economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic has added further complexity to the level of judgment required by the Group in calculating the ECL. | How the matter was addressed in our audit We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the key controls in place over the credit approval and review processes. We performed sample checks of credit reviews on loans and advances to critically assess the appropriateness of the credit grading and any objective evidence of impairment. We also considered the appropriateness of the criteria designed by management to identify significant increase in credit risk, considering the impacts of COVID-19. For credit impaired exposures, we assessed the reasonableness of management estimates of expected future cashflows, including the realisable value of collaterals if relevant. For non-credit impaired exposures, we reviewed the appropriateness of the ECL methodology and management's assumptions on the parameters used in the ECL model, including probability of default term structure, loss given default, exposure at default and macroeconomic factors. We also tested the accuracy of key data inputs into the ECL models for a sample of exposures as at year-end by checking them against source systems and documents. We independently re-calculated the ECL allowance for a sample of credit exposures to test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations produced by the ECL model. Based on our procedures performed, the methodology, |

## Other information

Management is responsible for the other information contained in the annual report.  Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.

We have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report except for the analysis of shareholding ('the Report'), which is expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

## Other information (Continued)

In  connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and,  in  doing  so,  consider  whether  the  other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the  financial  statements  or  our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

## Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to  provide  a  reasonable  assurance  that  assets  are  safeguarded  against  loss  from  unauthorised  use  or  disposition;  and transactions  are  properly  authorised  and  that  they  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  the  preparation  of  true  and  fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In  preparing  the  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Group's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  SSAs  will  always  detect  a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SSAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgement  and  maintain  professional  scepticism throughout the audit.  We also:

- l Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the override of internal controls.
- l Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  controls  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.
- l Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- l Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (Continued)

- l Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether  the  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  achieves  fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We  communicate  with  the  directors  regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope  and  timing  of  the  audit  and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.

We  also  provide  the  directors  with  a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical  requirements  regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of  the  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit  matters.    We  describe  these  matters  in our auditors'  report  unless  the  law  or  regulations  preclude  public  disclosure  about  the  matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In  our  opinion,  the  accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations  incorporated  in  Singapore  of  which  we  are  the  auditors  have  been  properly  kept  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Tan Chun Wei (Chen Junwei).

The financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group' and individually as 'Group entities').

## 2. Basis of preparation

## 2.1 Statement of compliance

The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Singapore  Financial  Reporting  Standards (International) (SFRS(I)).

## 2.2 Basis of measurement

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities which are measured at fair values.

## 2.3 Functional and presentation currency

These financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the Group's functional currency.  All financial information presented in Singapore dollars have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.

## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements, estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amounts  of  assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.    Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

Information  about  assumptions  and  estimation  uncertainties  that  have  a  significant  risk  of  resulting  in  a  material adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  is  included  in  note  3.4 Impairment.

## Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the estimation uncertainty in the preparation of the financial statements.

The estimation uncertainty is associated with:

- l the extent and duration of the expected economic downturn (and forecasts for key economic factors including gross domestic product (GDP));
- l the extent and duration of the disruption to business arising from the containment measures by government, businesses and consumers to contain the spread of the virus; and
- l the  effectiveness  of  government  and  central  bank  measures  that  have  and  will  be  put  in  place  to  support businesses and consumers through this disruption and economic downturn.

## 2. Basis of preparation (Continued)

## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements (Continued)

## Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (Continued)

The  Company  has  developed  accounting  estimates  based  on  forecasts  of  economic  conditions  which  reflect expectations and assumptions as at 31 December 2020 about future events that management believes are reasonable in the circumstances.

There is a considerable degree of judgement involved in preparing forecasts. The underlying assumptions are also subject to uncertainties which are often outside the control of the Company. Accordingly, actual economic conditions are  likely  to  be  different  from  those  forecast  since  anticipated  events  frequently  do  not  occur  as  expected,  and  the effect  of  those  differences  may  significantly  impact  accounting  estimates  included  in  these  financial  statements.  The significant  accounting estimate impacted by these forecasts and associated uncertainties is predominantly related to expected credit losses.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses is discussed further in note 22.

## 2.5 Changes in accounting policies

The Group has applied the following SFRS(I)s, amendments to and interpretations of SFRS(I) for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2020:

- l Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in SFRS(I) Standards
- l Definition of a Business (Amendments to SFRS(I) 3)
- l Definition of Material (Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) 1-8)
- l Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39 and SFRS(I) 7)

The application of these amendments to standards and interpretations does not have a material effect on the financial statements.

## 3 Significant accounting policies

The  accounting  policies  set  out  below  have  been  applied  consistently  to  all  periods  presented  in  these  financial statements, except as explained in note 2.5, which addresses changes in accounting policies.

## 3.1 Basis of consolidation

## (i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity, when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its  power  over  the  entity.  The  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.

## (ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group  balances  and  transactions,  and  any  unrealised  income  and  expenses  arising  from  intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

## (iii) Loss of control

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

## (iv) Accounting for subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company's balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.2 Property, plant and equipment

## (i) Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.  Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes:

- l the cost of materials and direct labour;
- l any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use;
- l when the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located; and
- l capitalised borrowing costs.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.

## (ii) Subsequent costs

The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably.  The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised.  The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.

## (iii) Depreciation

Depreciation  is  based  on  the  cost  of  an  asset  less  its  residual  value.    Significant  components  of  individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment, unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.  Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:

| Freehold land and buildings    | -   | 40 years                                           |
|--------------------------------|-----|----------------------------------------------------|
| Leasehold land and buildings   | -   | Lease period or useful lives, whichever is shorter |
| Furniture and office equipment | -   | Between 5 and 8 years                              |
| Motor vehicles                 | -   | 4 years                                            |
| Computers                      | -   | Between 3 and 5 years                              |

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments

- (i) Recognition and initial measurement

## Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits when they are originated.  All other financial assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  initially  recognised  when  the  Group  becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit  or  loss  ('FVTPL'),  transaction  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  its  acquisition  or  issue.  Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss.

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

## Non-derivative financial assets

## Classification

On initial  recognition,  a  financial  asset  is  classified  as  measured  at:  amortised  cost;  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') - debt investments; FVOCI - equity investments; or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL').

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.

## Financial assets at amortised cost

A  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  if  it  meets  both  of  the  following  conditions  and  is  not designated as at FVTPL:

- l it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- l its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## Debt investments at FVOCI

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- l it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- l its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## Equity investments at FVOCI

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI.  This election is made on an investment-byinvestment basis.

## Financial assets at FVTPL

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.  On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses (Continued)

## Business model assessment

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a  portfolio  level  because  this  best  reflects  the  way  the  business  is  managed  and  information  is  provided  to management.  The information considered includes:

- l the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- l how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;
- l the  risks  that  affect  the  performance  of  the  business  model  (and  the  financial  assets  held  within  that business model) and how those risks are managed;
- l how managers of the business are compensated - e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and
- l the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Transfers  of  financial  assets  to  third  parties  in  transactions  that  do  not  qualify  for  derecognition  are  not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.

Financial assets that are held-for-trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

## Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For  the  purposes  of  this  assessment,  'principal'  is  defined  as  the  fair  value  of  the  financial  asset  on  initial recognition.  'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

In  assessing  whether  the  contractual  cash  flows  are  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest,  the  Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument.  This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.  In making this assessment, the Group considers:

- l contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;
- l terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;
- l prepayment and extension features; and
- l terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for early termination of the contract.  Additionally, for a financial asset  acquired  at  a  significant  discount  or  premium  to  its  contractual  par  amount,  a  feature  that  permits  or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is  treated  as  consistent  with  this  criterion  if  the  fair  value  of  the  prepayment  feature  is  insignificant  at  initial recognition.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

- (ii) Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses (Continued)

## Subsequent measurement and gains and losses

## Financial assets at amortised cost

These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses.  Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.  Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

## Debt investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.  Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI.  On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.

## Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value.  Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.  Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

## Financial assets at FVTPL

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value.  Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.

## Non-derivative financial liabilities

## Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.

## (iii) Derecognition

## Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

## Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition  of  a  financial  liability,  the  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  extinguished  and  the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)

## (iv) Modifications of financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different.

If  the  cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- l fees  that  are  considered  in  determining  the  fair  value  of  the  new  asset  and  fees  that  represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- l other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If  cash  flows  are  modified  when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is  usually  to  maximise  recovery  of  the  original  contractual  terms  rather  than  to  originate  a  new  asset  with substantially  different  terms.  If  the  Group  plans  to  modify  a  financial  asset  in  a  way  that  would  result  in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss.

For floating-rate financial  assets,  the  original  effective  interest  rate  used  to  calculate  the  modification  gain  or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs or fees incurred and modification fees received adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If  such  a  modification  is  carried  out  because  of  financial  difficulties  of  the  borrower,  then  the  gain  or  loss  is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

## (v) Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## (vi) Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.4 Impairment

- (i) Non-derivative financial assets

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses ('ECLs') on:

- l financial assets measured at amortised costs; and
- l debt investments measured at FVOCI.

Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases:

- l 12-month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after  the  reporting  date  (or  for  a  shorter  period  if  the  expected  life  of  the  instrument  is  less  than  12 months); or
- l Lifetime  ECLs:  these  are  ECLs  that  result  from  all  possible  default  events  over  the  expected  life  of  a financial instrument.

## General approach

The Group applies the general approach to provide for ECLs on all other financial instruments.  Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs at initial recognition.

At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  assesses  whether  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  instrument  has  increased significantly  since  initial  recognition.    When  credit  risk  has  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition,  loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.  This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based  on  the  Group's  historical  experience  and  informed  credit  assessment  and  includes  forward-looking information.

If  credit  risk  has  not  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition  or  if  the  credit  quality  of  the  financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- l the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or
- l the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

The Group considers a financial  guarantee  to  be  in  default  when  the  debtor  of  the  loan  is  unlikely  to  pay its  credit  obligations  to  the  creditor  and  the  Group  in  full,  without  recourse  by  the  Group  to  actions  such  as realising security (if any is held).  The Group only applies a discount rate if, and to the extent that, the risks are not taken into account by adjusting the expected cash shortfalls.

The Group considers Singapore Government securities and bank deposits to have low credit risk when their credit  risk  rating  is  equivalent  to  'investment  grade'  assigned  by  internationally  recognised  external  credit rating agencies.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.4 Impairment (Continued)

- (i) Non-derivative financial assets (Continued)

## Measurement of ECLs

ECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses.  Credit losses are measured at the present value of all  cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive).  ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

## Credit-impaired financial assets

At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  assesses  whether  financial  assets  carried  at  amortised  cost  and  debt investments at FVOCI are credit-impaired.  A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- l significant financial difficulty of the borrower;
- l a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;
- l the  restructuring  of  a  loan  or  advance  by  the  Group  on  terms  that  the  Group  would  not  consider otherwise;
- l it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- l the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

## Presentation of allowance for ECLs in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.

For debt investments at FVOCI, loss allowances are charged to profit or loss and recognised in OCI.

Loss allowances for financial guarantee are recognised as a financial liability to the extent that they exceed the initial carrying amount of the financial guarantee less the cumulated income recognised.

## Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.  This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off.  However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

## (ii) Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  If any such indication exists, then the  asset's  recoverable  amount  is  estimated.    For  goodwill,  and  intangible  assets  that  have  indefinite  useful lives  or  that  are  not  yet  available  for  use,  the  recoverable  amount  is  estimated  each  year  at  the  same  time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.4 Impairment (Continued)

## (ii) Non-financial assets (Continued)

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.  For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

Impairment  losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.    Impairment  losses  recognised  in  respect  of  CGUs  are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An  impairment  loss  in  respect  of  goodwill  is  not  reversed.  In  respect  of  other  assets,  impairment  losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or  no  longer  exists.    An  impairment  loss  is  reversed  if  there  has  been  a  change  in  the  estimates  used  to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount  does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been  determined,  net  of  depreciation  or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

## 3.5 Employee benefits

## Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.  Obligations for contributions to  defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees.

## Other long-term employee benefits

The Group's net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than defined contribution plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is  accrued annually at a specified rate based on salaries paid to employees during the period.  Benefits are only applicable to employees who joined before 28 December 2002 and completed 12 years of continuous service.

## Short-term benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service  is  provided.    A  liability  is  recognised  for  the  amount  expected  to  be  paid  under  short-term  cash  bonus  or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## 3.6 Provisions

A provision  is  recognised  if,  as  a  result  of  a  past  event,  the  Group  has  a  present  legal  or  constructive  obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.    Provisions  are  determined  by  discounting  the  expected  future  cash  flows  at  a  pre-tax  rate  that  reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.

## 3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## 3.7 Interest

Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.  The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortised cost of the financial liability.  The effective interest rate is established on initial recognition of the financial assets and is not revised subsequently unless contractually adjusted.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.  Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.

Interest income and expense presented in the income statement include interest on financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost on an effective interest rate basis.

Where charges are added to the principal financed at the commencement of the period, the general principle adopted for crediting income to profit or loss is to spread the income over the period in which the repayments are due using the following bases for the various categories of financing business:-

Interest income on loans and advances

In general, the basis adopted for crediting income from loans to profit or loss is to spread the interest over the period in which the repayments are due.  Interest on mortgage loans is charged on the annual/monthly/daily rest basis and credited to profit or loss in the period to which it relates.

## Interest rebate on hire purchase

Term charges on hire purchase and leasing transactions are accounted for using the Rule of 78 (sum of digits) method. The balance of such term charges at the financial year end is carried forward as unearned charges.

Interest income from Singapore Government Securities

Interest income from Singapore Government Securities is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.

Interest income from bank deposits

Interest income from bank deposits is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.

## 3.8 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the shareholder's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend date.

## 3.9 Government grants

Government grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss as 'other income' on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised, unless the condition for receiving the grant are met after the related expenses have been recognised. In this case, the grant is recognised when it becomes receivable.

## 3.10 Tax

Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.  Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets .

## 3.10 Tax (Continued)

Current tax is  the  expected  tax  payable  or  receivable  on  the  taxable  income  or  loss  for  the  year,  measured  using tax  rates  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at  the  reporting  date,  and  any  adjustment  to  tax  payable  in  respect  of previous years.  The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  amounts  used  for  taxation  purposes.    Deferred  tax  is  not  recognised  for temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects  neither  accounting  nor  taxable  profit  or  loss,  and  temporary  differences  relating  to  investments  in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The measurement of deferred taxes reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on tax rates  and  tax  laws  that  have  been  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  by  the  reporting  date,  and  reflects  uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  offset  current  tax  liabilities  and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at  each  reporting  date  and  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

## 3.11 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

## As a lessee

At  commencement  or  on  modification  of  a  contract  that  contains  a  lease  component,  the  Group  allocates  the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is  initially  measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use  asset  will  be  depreciated  over  the  useful  life  of  the  underlying  asset,  which  is  determined  on  the  same basis  as  those  of  property  and  equipment.  In  addition,  the  right-of-use  asset  is  periodically  reduced  by  impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

## 3.11 Leases (Continued)

## As a lessee (Continued)

The  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease  payments  that  are  not  paid  at  the commencement  date,  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  or,  if  that  rate  cannot  be  readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The  Group  determines  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate  by  obtaining  interest  rates  from  various  external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- l fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- l amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- l the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.  It  is  remeasured  when  there is  a  change  in  future  lease  payments  arising  from  a  change  in  an  index  or  rate,  if  there  is  a  change  in  the  Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'trade and other payables' in the balance sheet.

## Short term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including IT equipment. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## 3.12 Earnings per share

The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares.  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.  Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

## Extension options

Some property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Company up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Company seeks to include extension options in new leases to  provide  operational  flexibility.  The  extension  options  held  are  exercisable  only  by  the  Company  and  not  by  the lessors. The Company assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Company reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.

The Company has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $1,114,000.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 22 Financial risk management

## Overview

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

- l credit risk
- l liquidity risk
- l market risk

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital.

## Risk management framework

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.  The Board has established the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies.  The RMC reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.

The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risk and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are  reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.  All major policy decisions and approval on risk exposures including loan limits are approved by the Board of Directors upon concurrence by the RMC.  In addition, internal audits are conducted on an on-going basis to confirm that these policies and procedures are functioning effectively and any deviations are duly highlighted for special attention.

## Credit risk

Credit  risk  is  the  risk  of  financial  loss  to  the  Group  if  a  customer  or  counterparty  to  a  financial  instrument  fails  to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's loans and advances to customers.  For risk management reporting purposes, the Group considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure.

## Management of credit risk

The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of credit risk to the RMC, which in turn appoints the  Credit  Control  Committee  and  Credit  Portfolio  Committee  to  assist  in  the  management  of  credit  risk.  The Credit Control Committee develops the credit risk management framework, policies and procedures for review and concurrence by RMC and approval by the Board of Directors. The Credit Control Committee also reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions.

Credit  reviews  are  conducted  regularly  to  monitor  the  health  of  the  loan  portfolio  and  to  detect  early  signs  of weaknesses and deviations.

The  Credit  Portfolio  Committee  manages  risk  on  a  portfolio-wide  basis  and  recommends  alternative  portfolio strategies, analyses results of portfolio management actions, and develops portfolio limits for each portfolio segment for approval by the RMC.  Credit risk concentration is addressed by setting a credit portfolio mix limit and monitoring the  limit  on  a  regular  basis.  The  Credit  Portfolio  Committee  periodically  reviews  the  lending  authority  framework, portfolio concentration limits and credit stress test framework.

Credit  stress  tests  are  also  conducted  periodically  to  determine  the  impact  of  security  values  and  other  stress parameters on the loan portfolio.  This allows the Group to assess the potential financial impact of losses arising from plausible adverse scenarios on the Group's loan portfolio.

The  SFRS(I)  9  Committee  ('SC')  works  closely  with  Credit  Portfolio  Committee  and  Credit  Control  Committee to  ensure  that  the  Group  has  appropriate  credit  risk  practices,  including  an  effective  system  of  internal  control,  to consistently  determine  adequate  allowances  in  accordance  with  the  Group's  policies  and  procedures  relating  to impairment allowances and applicable accounting framework under SFRS(I) 9. The SC also reviews and recommends updates to the Governance &amp; Control Framework of ECL Model as well as the Impairment Allowance Policy. Any material changes to the ECL framework, methodology and policies are reviewed by SC before recommendation to the Audit Committee for concurrence and approval.

## Assessment of significant increase in credit risk

When  determining  whether  the  risk  of  default  on  a  financial  instrument  has  increased  significantly  since  initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Group considers significant increase in credit risk occurs when an asset is more than 30 days past due.

## Modified financial assets

The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 3.3 (iv).

For loans subjected to the COVID-19 repayment deferral arrangements, an assessment of significant increase in credit risk has been determined based on various measures of the customer's current financial position and earnings capacity from which the loans are categorised into risk categories - Low, Medium and High. Significant increase in credit risk is then determined based on the resulting risk categorisation. Customers who have requested a deferral extension and are categorised as High risk are classified as having a significant increase in credit risk.

## Calculation of expected credit losses

Expected credit losses are calculated using three main components

- l probability of default (PD);
- l loss given default (LGD); and
- l exposure at default (EAD).

These components are generally derived from internally developed statistical models using historical, current and forward-looking macro-economic data such as GDP, unemployment and inflation. These factors were updated in 2020, reflecting the actual and expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Probability of default

The 12-month and lifetime PD represent the expected point-in-time probability of a default over the next 12 months and remaining lifetime of the financial instrument, respectively, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date and future economic conditions that affect credit risk.

The PD is derived using Delinquency Roll Rate Model which incorporates historical  default  rates  over  past  years, adjusted for forward-looking information and reflecting current portfolio composition and market data such as GDP, unemployment and inflation.

## Loss given default

LGD  represents  expected  loss  conditional  on  default,  taking  into  account  the  mitigating  effect  of  collateral,  its expected value when realised and the time value of money.

## Exposure at default

EAD  represents  the  expected  exposure  in  the  event  of  a  default.  The  Group  derives  the  EAD  from  the  current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortisation. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations.

The 12-month ECL is equal to the discounted sum over the next 12 months of monthly PD multiplied by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the discounted sum of monthly PD over the full remaining life multiplied by LGD and EAD.

## Exposure to credit risk

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets in the statements of financial position, reduced by the value of the collateral held.

Past  due  but  not  impaired :  when  contractual  interest  or  principal  payments  are  past  due  by  not  more  than  three months and the Group believes that impairment is not appropriate on the basis of the security available and/or the stage of collection.

Write off :  The Group writes off wholly or partially loan balances (together with any related allowances for impairment losses)  when the Group determines that the debts are irrecoverable, e.g. borrower has been made bankrupt, or all actions have been exhausted.

Covid-19 repayment deferral :  Since  March  2020,  the  Group  has  offered  various  forms  of  assistance  to  customers  to counteract the impact of COVID-19 on the ability of customers to meet their loan obligations. The assistance provided has included arrangements such as temporary deferral of principal and interest repayments, and extension of loan maturity dates.

The  loan  repayment  deferral  is  considered  to  be  a  loan  modification  which  either  results  in  the  loan  being derecognised and replaced with a new loan (substantial modification) or the existing loan continuing to be recognised (non-substantial modification).

The table below shows the outstanding balance as at 31 December 2020 of all loans that have been modified:

|                                                 | Group and Company   |

|                                                 | $'000               |
| Interest servicing only                         | 72,410              |
| Full/partial deferral of principal and interest | 37,648              |
| Total                                           | 110,058             |

The amortised cost of loans at the date of modification that were considered non-substantial modifications and had loss allowances based on lifetime expected losses was $17,352,000. No gain or loss was recognised as a result of the modification and none of the loans have subsequently changed to a 12-month expected loss allowance.

The Group normally holds collateral against loans and advances to customers.  These are in the form of mortgage interests over property and ownership or other registered interests over assets.  Estimates of fair value of collateral are assessed in each accounting period prior to determination of individual impairment allowances.

The financial  effect  of  collateral  and  other  security  enhancements  held  against  loans  and  advances  to  customers  is shown below:

At the reporting date, there was no significant concentration of credit risk.

## Debt investments

The  Group  and  the  Company  held  Singapore  Government  securities  of  $123,465,000  as  at  31  December  2020 (2019: $124,782,000).  The credit rating of Singapore Government Securities held at the reporting date accorded by various international credit rating agencies is AAA (2019: AAA).  The Group considers that its debt investments have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Hence, the amount of the allowance on debt investments is negligible.

## Cash and balances with banks

The Group and the Company held cash and balances with banks of $181,054,000 and $180,963,000 respectively at 31 December 2020 (2019: $224,843,000 and $224,759,000).  The cash and balances with banks are mainly held with bank and financial institution counterparties which are rated BBB+ to AA, based on various international credit ratings.

Loss allowance on cash and balances with banks has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures.  The Group considers that its cash and balances with banks have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.

The Group uses a similar approach for assessment of ECLs for cash and balances with banks to those used for loans and advances. The amount of the allowance on cash and balances with banks is negligible.

## Statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore

The Group and the Company held statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore of $21,421,000 at 31 December 2020 (2019: $18,280,000) which is rated AAA, based on various international credit ratings. Hence, the Group considers that its statutory deposits have low credit risk and the amount of allowance is negligible.

## Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.

## Management of liquidity risk

The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.

The Group is currently funded from equity and deposit liabilities.  Liquidity risk arises from the management of the net funding position after accounting for the ongoing cash flows from the loan assets, the deposit liabilities and the interest-bearing placements at various points in time.

Liquidity  risk  is  managed  in  accordance  to  the  Group's  liquidity  framework  of  policies,  contingency  funding  plan, controls and limits approved by the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO).  This framework ensures that liquidity risk is  monitored and managed in a manner that ensures sufficient sources of funds are available over a range of market conditions.  Stress testing is conducted under the Group/Company-specific crisis and general market crisis scenarios. This is undertaken to assess and plan for the impact of the scenarios which may put the Group's liquidity at risk.

Liquidity risk is also mitigated through the large number of customers in its diverse loans and deposits bases and the close monitoring of exposure to avoid any undue concentration.

## Maturity analysis of financial liabilities

The following are the contractual maturities of the Group's and Company's non-derivatives financial liabilities, loan commitments and contingent liabilities at the reporting date, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows (including interest payments) at the earliest date the Group and Company can be required to pay.

The expected cash flows on these instruments may vary significantly from this analysis.  In particular, deposits from customers are expected to maintain a stable balance; and undrawn loan commitments are not all available to be drawn down immediately upon finalisation of legal documentation due to factors like the progressive nature of the facility to be based on the stage of completion of work in progress.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 22 Financial risk management (Continued)

## Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates will  affect  the  Group's  income  or  the  value  of  its  holdings  of  financial  instruments.    The  objective  of  market  risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

## Currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of financial assets or liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  The Group is not exposed to foreign currency risk.

## Interest rate risk

Interest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  value  of  the  Group's  financial  assets  and/or  financial  liabilities  changes  because of changes in interest rates.  Interest rate risk arises primarily from the fact that financial assets and financial liabilities typically reprice at different points in time.

## Risk management policy

The overall objective of interest  rate  risk  management  is  to  manage  current  and  future  earnings  sensitivity  arising from various interest rate exposures.  Interest rate risk exposures are measured using a combination of repricing gap, present value of 1 basis point reports and simulation modelling.  The ALCO recommends policies, ratios and limits for review and concurrence by RMC and approval by the Board of Directors. The RMC assists the Board in ensuring the effective management of market risks. The ALCO meets periodically to review the risk profile of the Group against the prevailing business and economic conditions, focusing on market and interest rate risks.  The ALCO also relates the structure of assets and liabilities to funding mismatches and interest rate repricing risks and ensure compliance with the approved policies and risk exposures (including ratios and limits).

## Exposure to interest rate risk

The Group does not hold a trading portfolio.  The principal risk to which its non-trading portfolio is exposed arises from the risk of fluctuations in the future cash flows or fair values of financial instruments because of changes in market interest  rates.    Interest  rate  risk  is  managed  principally  through  monitoring  interest  rate  gaps  and  by  having  preapproved limits for repricing bands.

The Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group's loan and investment portfolios as well as deposit liabilities.  Interest rate risk will arise when these assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times or in differing amounts, or when market conditions dictate the extent of repricing possible.  The Group manages this risk through diversity in its loan portfolio and to a lesser extent in its deposit portfolio.

## Sensitivity analysis

## Interest rate risk

Interest rate sensitivity analyses are performed under various interest rate scenarios using simulation modelling where the sensitivity of projected net interest income is measured against changes in market interest rates.

The projected impact on future net interest income before tax over the next twelve months from the close of the year is simulated under various interest rate assumptions.  Based on a 100 basis point parallel rise in yield curves applied to the reporting date position, net interest income is estimated to decrease by $303,000 (2019: increased by $2,159,000). The corresponding impact from a 100 basis point fall is an estimated reduction of $2,817,000 (2019: $3,080,000) in net interest income.

The  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  Group  is  illustrative  only.    It  assumes  that  interest  rates  of  all  tenors  move  by  the same amount and does not reflect the potential impact on net interest income of some rates changing while others remained unchanged.  The analysis also assumes that all financial assets and liabilities run to contractual maturity without action by the Group to mitigate any impact of such changes.

## Portfolio price risk

Portfolio price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to the individual security or factors that affect all instruments in the market.

At the reporting date, the Group has FVOCI-debt instruments on Singapore Government Securities of approximately $123 million (2019: $125 million).  A 1% increase in prices at the reporting date would have increased equity by $1.2 million  (2019:  $1.3million).    An  equal  change  in  the  opposite  direction  would  have  decreased equity by $1.2 million (2019: $1.3 million).  The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2019.

At the reporting date, the Group has FVOCI-equity instruments of approximately $1.5 million (2019: $7 million).  A 10% increase in prices at the reporting date would have increased equity by $0.2 million (2019: $0.7 million).  An equal change in the opposite direction would have decreased equity by $0.2 million (2019: $0.7 million). The Group's net profit for the year ended 31 December 2020 would have seen unaffected as the equity investment is classified as FVOCI.

The sensitivity analysis is based on management's best estimate of the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change.  In practice, the actual results will differ from the sensitivity analysis and the differences could be material.

## Capital management

## Regulatory capital

The Group maintains a capital  adequacy  ratio  ('CAR')  in  excess  of  the  prescribed  ratio,  which  is  expressed  as  a percentage of adjusted regulatory capital to total risk weighted assets.

- (1) The Group's adjusted regulatory capital includes share capital, capital reserve, statutory reserve, general reserve, fair value reserve relating to unrealised losses on equity securities classified as FVOCI and accumulated profits.

## 23 Fair values of financial instruments

In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and make assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.

Although management have employed their best judgement in the estimation of fair values, there is inevitably a significant element of subjectivity involved in the calculations.  Therefore, the fair value estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Group could have realised in a sales transaction at the reporting date.

## 23 Fair values of financial instruments (Continued)

The methodologies and assumptions used depend on the terms and risk characteristics of the various instruments and include the following:

## Financial instruments for which fair value approximates the carrying amount

The carrying values of statutory deposit with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, other receivables and deposits, cash and balances with banks and trade and other payables, approximate their fair values as these balances are shortterm in nature or are receivable or payable on demand.

## Investment in Singapore Government Securities and equity securities

The fair  values  of  FVOCI-debt  instruments  are  determined  by  reference  to  their  quoted  closing  bid  prices  at  the reporting date.

In 2020, the fair value of the FVOCI-equity instrument is determined using the discounted cash flows method. In 2019, the fair  value  of  the  FVOCI-equity  instrument  was  assumed  to  approximate  the  carrying  value  because  of  the  short period between the transaction date and reporting date.

## Loans and advances

The fair  value  of  loans  and  advances  that  mature  or  reprice  within  six  months  of  the  reporting  date  is  assumed  to equate to the carrying value.  The fair value of all other loans and advances was calculated using discounted cash flow models based on the maturity of the loans. The discount rates applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of loans.

## Deposits and savings accounts of customers

The fair value of deposits and savings accounts of customers which mature or reprice within six months is estimated to be the carrying value at the reporting date.  The fair value of other term deposits was calculated using discounted cash flow models, based on the deposit type and its related maturity.  The discount rates applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of deposits.

## Fair value hierarchy

The table below analyses fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities, by the levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques.  The different levels are defined as follows:

- l Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date.
- l Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
- l Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

For more information on Mr Jamie Teo,  Mrs  Yu-Foo  and  Mr  Terence  Khoo,  please  refer  to  the  sections  entitled  'Board  of  Directors'  and  'Additional  information  on Directors seeking re-election' in the Annual Report 2020.
- (ii) Ordinary Resolution 7 is to empower the Directors, effective until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company, or the date by which the next Annual General Meeting of the Company is required by law to be held, or the date such authority is varied or revoked by the Company in general meeting, whichever is the earlier, to issue shares of the Company and to make or grant instruments (such as warrants or debentures) convertible into shares, and to issue shares in pursuance of such instruments, up to a number not exceeding fifty per cent (50%) of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) of the Company, of which up to twenty per cent (20%) of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) may be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders.

For the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares that may be issued, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares) of the Company at the time that Ordinary Resolution 7 is passed, after  adjusting  for  (a)  new  shares  arising  from  the  conversion  or  exercise  of  any  convertible  securities  or  share  options  or  vesting  of share awards, and (b) any subsequent bonus issue or consolidation or subdivision of shares. These adjustments are only to be made in  respect  of  new  shares  arising  from  convertible  securities,  share  options  or  share  awards  which  were  issued  and  outstanding  or subsisting at the time of the passing of this Resolution. As at the date of this Notice, the Company did not have any treasury shares or subsidiary holdings.

- (iii) Ordinary Resolutions 8(a)(i), 8(a)(ii),  8(b)(i),  8(b)(ii),  8(c)(i),  8(c)(ii),  8(d)(i),  8(d)(ii),  8(e)(i)  and  8(e)(ii)  are  proposed  in  compliance  with  Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST which will take effect from 1 January 2022.

Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST provides that a Director will not be independent if he/she has been a Director for an aggregate period of more than nine years and his/her continued appointment as an Independent Director has not been sought and approved in separate resolutions by (a) all shareholders; and (b) shareholders excluding the Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and their respective associates (the 'Two-Tier Voting').

Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon,  Mr  Phua  Bah  Lee,  Mr  Teoh  Eng  Hong,  Mr  William  Ho  Ah  Seng  and  Mdm  Tan  Hui  Keng  Martha  are  the Independent Directors who have served more than nine years.

In view of the challenges brought about by the ongoing Covid-19, the Board, saved for the affected directors who had abstained from all  deliberation,  have  recommended the continued appointment of Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng and Mdm Tan Hui Keng Martha as Independent Directors to assist the Board to address these challenges, via a Two-Tier Voting process for a three-year term with effect from the date of passing the ordinary resolutions via the Two-Tier Voting.

The Board seeks to strike an appropriate balance between tenure of service, continuity of experience and refreshment of the Board. Such refreshment process will take some time in order to maintain stability of the Board. In addition, all the Independent Directors are sitting in the respective Board Committees which require special skillset and experience and their contribution are still required at the Committees level.

The Nominating Committee and the Board have determined that Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng and Mdm Tan Hui Keng Martha remain objective and independent-minded in the Board deliberations. Their vast experience enable them to provide the Board and the various Board Committees on which they serve, with pertinent experience and competence to facilitate sound decision-making and that their length of service does not in any way interfere with their exercise of  independent judgement nor hinder their ability to act in the best interests of the Company. Additionally, they have fulfilled the definition of Independent Directors of the SGX-ST Listing Rules and the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 (2018 Code). The Board trust that they are able to continue to discharge their duties independently with integrity and competency.

Upon passing the Ordinary Resolutions 8(a)(i), 8(a)(ii),  8(b)(i),  8(b)(ii),  8(c)(i),  8(c)(ii),  8(d)(i),  8(d)(ii),  8(e)(i)  and  8(e)(ii)  respectively,  the continued appointment of each of Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr Phua Bah Lee, Mr Teoh Eng Hong, Mr William Ho Ah Seng and Mdm Tan Hui Keng Martha as an Independent Director of the Company shall continue in force until the earlier of : (i) the retirement or resignation of the Independent Director as a Director; or (ii) the conclusion of the third AGM of the Company following the passing of these Ordinary Resolutions.

Should the Ordinary Resolution(s) for the continued appointment of the Independent Director(s) is/are not passed at the forthcoming AGM, the Independent Director(s) will no longer be independent and shall continue as non-independent director(s) of the Company.

Rule  210(5)(c)  of  the  SGX-ST  Listing  Rules  and  the  Provision  2.2  of  the  2018  Code  provides  that  the  Independent  Directors  must comprise of at least one-third of the Board and the Independent Directors shall make up a majority of the Board where the Chairman is  not  independent  respectively.  In  the  event  that  the  Ordinary  Resolution(s)  for  the  continued  appointment  of  the  Independent Director(s) is/are not passed at the forthcoming AGM which renders the Company unable to meet these requirements, the Company shall endeavour to fill the vacancy(ies) in the Board to comply with the Rules 210(5)(c) and 704(8) of the SGX-ST Listing Rules and the Provision 2.2 of the 2018 Code.

Please note that members will not be able to ask questions at the AGM 'live' during the webcast and the audio feed and therefore it is important for members to submit their questions in advance of the AGM.

3. Due to the current Covid-19 restriction orders in Singapore, a member will not be able to attend the AGM in person. A member (whether individual or corporate) must appoint the Chairman of the AGM as his/her/its proxy to attend, speak and vote on his/her/its behalf at the AGM if such member wishes to exercise his/her/its voting rights at the AGM. The accompanying proxy form for the AGM may be accessed at the Company's website at the URL https://www.singapurafinance.com.sg/agm2020.php, and will also be made available on the SGXNet.

Where a member (whether individual or corporate) appoints the Chairman of the AGM as his/her/its proxy, he/she/it must give specific instructions as to voting, or abstentions from voting, in respect of a resolution in the form of proxy, failing which the appointment of the Chairman of the AGM as proxy for that resolution will be treated as invalid.

CPF or SRS investors who wish to appoint the Chairman of the AGM as proxy should approach their respective CPF Agent Banks or SRS Operators to submit their votes by 11.00 a.m. on 14 April 2021.

4. The Chairman of the AGM, as proxy, need not be a member of the Company.
5. The instrument appointing the Chairman of the AGM as proxy must be submitted to the Company in the following manner:
3. (a) if submitted personally or by post, be deposited at the registered office of the Company at 150 Cecil Street #01-00, Singapore 069543; or
4. (b) if submitted electronically, be submitted via email to the Company at investors.relations@singapurafinance.com.sg,

in either case, by not later than 11.00 a.m. on 20 April 2021, being not less than 72 hours before the time appointed for holding the AGM.

A member who wishes to submit an instrument of proxy must first download, complete and sign the proxy form, before submitting it by post to the address provided above, or before scanning and sending it by email to the email address provided above.

In view of the current Covid-19 situation and the related safe distancing measures which may make it difficult for members to submit completed proxy forms by post, members are strongly encouraged to submit completed proxy forms electronically via email.

6. The Annual Report 2020 may be accessed at the Company's website at the URL https://www.singapurafinance.com.sg/investor.php and on the SGXNet.

## Personal data privacy:

By submitting an instrument appointing the Chairman of the AGM to attend, speak and vote at the AGM and/or any adjournment thereof, a member of the Company consents to the collection, use and disclosure of the member's personal data by the Company (or its agents or service providers) for the purpose of the processing, administration and analysis by the Company (or its agents or service providers) of the appointment of the Chairman of the AGM as proxy for the AGM (including any adjournment thereof) and the preparation and compilation of the attendance lists, minutes and other documents relating to the AGM (including any adjournment thereof), and in order for the Company (or its agents or service providers) to comply with any applicable laws, listing rules, take-over rules, regulations and/or guidelines.

In 2004, Mr Khoo had assisted the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in their investigations on a matter involving the SportsSG (then known as the Singapore Sports Council) where Mr Khoo was employed.
